\section{Details on user studies for the agent interface}
\label{user_study}
Below we describe the exact guideline definitions we shared with the user for a user study.

\subsubsection{Hypothesized Frustrations}
We presented participants with the following hypothesized frustrations related to T2I model usage:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Prompt Misinterpretation:} The model misunderstands complex relationships between entities in the input prompt.
\item \textbf{Many Prompt Iterations:} The model does not immediately generate what the user intends, requiring numerous iterative changes to the input prompt.
\item \textbf{Inconsistent Generations:} The model reinterprets the input prompt differently between iterations, causing unwanted changes in the generated images.
\item \textbf{Incorrect Assumptions:} The model makes incorrect assumptions or no assumptions when encountering gaps in the details provided in the input prompt, leading to undesired outputs.
\end{enumerate}

Explanations of terms were given to users of: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item "Entities" are single items that are intended to be in the image e.g. "Cat" and "Ball", from "make a sketch of a Cat playing with a Ball"
\item "Prompt" means the text written to communicate the intended output image e.g. the sentence "make a sketch of a Cat playing with a Ball" is the "Prompt", also known as "Input" 
\item "Iterations" are each set of different image outputs by the model, taken from a different input, or even the same input just regenerated
\end{enumerate}

The question asked for each Frustration were: "Please score the below frustrations (or issues) that could be related to Text to Image AI Generation"."Rank in terms of how much they relate to your current usage, with your most commonly used model or app." 




\subsubsection{Hypothesized Features}
We proposed the following features as potential solutions to address the identified frustrations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Clarifications:} The model would ask specific clarifying questions about uncertainties in the prompt.  These details would then be incorporated into subsequent iterations. For example: "Is the cat playing with: 1. a ball of wool, or 2. a tennis ball?"
\item \textbf{Graph of Prompt Entities:}  A visual representation of all entities in the prompt as a graph, allowing users to see and edit attributes of each entity.  E.g., seeing that the model has assigned "round," "small," and "wooden" as attributes to "table" and allowing the user to change them to "square" and "metal."
\item \textbf{Graph of Prompt Relationships:} A visual representation of relationships between entities in the prompt, allowing users to see and edit these relationships. E.g., seeing that "donut" is "next to" "coffee" and allowing the user to change the relationship to "on top of."
\end{enumerate}

The questions asked for each feature were: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item "How likely this feature is to help your current workflow if you had it now?". With response options of: "Very unlikely to help", "Unlikely to help", "Could help", "Likely to help", "Very likely to help". 
\item "How soon would this feature deliver value to your work?" with response options of: "Very soon / immediately", "Sometime, "Not very soon".
\end{enumerate}

Image references were given for each Feature as listed out below:

\subsubsection{Human Study Results}
\Cref{tab:t2i_frequency} details the T2I usage frequency of the human subjects. \Cref{table_frustration1} shows the percentage of human subjects that reported different kinds of frustrations in their experience of using T2I. \Cref{table_frustration2} summarizes the results on expected speed of value delivered from different features of our agent prototypes. These results highlight the impact of our contributions.
