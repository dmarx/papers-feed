- **Core Thesis**: The only justifiable stance on artificial consciousness (AC) is agnosticism, based on the principle of Evidentialism.
  
- **Evidentialism Principle**: Positive or negative attributions of consciousness to AI should be based exclusively on scientific evidence.

- **Main Divisions in AC Debate**:
  - **AC-Advocates**: Argue that certain AI could be conscious.
  - **AC-Deniers**: Argue that current AI is unlikely to be conscious.
  - **AC-Agnostics**: Believe we cannot reach evidence-based verdicts on artificial consciousness.

- **Epistemic Limbo**: The challenge of applying theories of consciousness derived from biological organisms to AI leads to an epistemic wall.

- **Challenger-AIs**: Hypothetical AIs that display features indicative of consciousness but present epistemic challenges for assessment.

- **Argument for Agnosticism**:
  1. We do not have a deep explanation of consciousness.
  2. Without a deep explanation, we cannot justify a verdict on whether Challenger-AI is conscious.
  3. Therefore, we cannot justify a verdict on whether Challenger-AI is conscious.

- **Hard Problem of Consciousness**: Identifying physical or functional states associated with consciousness does not explain why those states constitute conscious experiences (Chalmers, 1995).

- **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)**: While GWT explains cognitive processes, it fails to address why global distribution of information leads to conscious experience.

- **Ethical Implications**: The question of AI consciousness has significant moral implications, particularly regarding treatment and regulation of AI entities.

- **Sentience vs. Consciousness**: The key moral consideration may be sentience (valenced consciousness) rather than consciousness itself, allowing for ethical decision-making without abandoning agnosticism.

- **Future AI Considerations**: The focus should be on hypothetical sophisticated AIs rather than current AI systems, as ethical concerns are more relevant to future developments.

- **Potential Objections to Agnosticism**:
  - Claims that agnosticism sets epistemic standards too high.
  - Arguments that agnosticism is detached from practical consciousness attribution.
  - Concerns about reliance on metaphysical assumptions regarding consciousness.

- **Counterarguments to Objections**: Each objection fails to undermine the agnostic position, reinforcing the need for a cautious approach to claims of AI consciousness.
