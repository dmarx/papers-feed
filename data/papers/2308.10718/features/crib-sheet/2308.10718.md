- **Concept Censorship**: Regulates personalization models (Textual Inversion) to prevent malicious use while allowing normal generation.
  
- **Textual Inversion (TI)**: A lightweight personalization technique that creates a pseudo-word (S*) embedding for specific concepts, optimizing it to minimize the distance between generated and reference images.

- **Backdoor Technique**: Injects backdoors into TI embeddings by selecting sensitive words as triggers, which, when used in prompts, lead to predefined target images instead of the intended content.

- **Key Challenges**:
  - **Preserving Benign Fidelity**: Ensures the embedding can still generate high-quality images.
  - **Preserving Benign Editability**: Allows the censored pseudo-word to work with non-censored words for diverse outputs.
  - **Generality of Censorship**: Censorship must be effective regardless of how the malicious user combines the censored words in prompts.

- **Loss Function Modification**: Introduces a new term in the original TI loss function to formulate the optimization problem while retaining original utility.

- **Denoising Diffusion Model (DDPM)**: The model generates images by iteratively denoising a noisy input, with the process defined by:
  - Forward process: \( x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon \)
  - Loss function: \( L = \sum_{t=1}^{T} ||\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)||^2 \)

- **Experimental Validation**: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in censoring sensitive words while maintaining model utility and robustness against countermeasures.

- **Ablation Studies**: Conducted to explore the design choices and their impacts on performance and censorship effectiveness.

- **Practical Implications**: The method allows for the regulation of personalization models without completely disabling their functionality, addressing security concerns in AI-generated content.
