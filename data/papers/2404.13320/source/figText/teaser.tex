  \caption{\textbf{Pixel is a Barrier for Attacking DMs}: (a) Pixel-based diffusion models are harder to attack using white-box attacks like project-gradient-descent than diffusion models in the latent space. (b) Strong PDM can be used as a universal purifier to effectively remove the protective perturbation generated by existing protection methods. (c) Pixel is a barrier and the pixel-space diffusion model is quite robust, and we cannot achieve real safety and protection if pixel-space diffusion is not attacked. }
