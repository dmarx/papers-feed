- **Key Insight**: Pixel-space diffusion models (PDMs) exhibit significantly higher adversarial robustness compared to latent diffusion models (LDMs).
  
- **Adversarial Attack Mechanism**: Existing adversarial attacks primarily target LDMs, which are vulnerable due to their encoder-decoder architecture. PDMs, operating directly in pixel space, are less susceptible to these attacks.

- **Adversarial Loss for LDMs**: The adversarial loss for LDMs is defined as:
  \[
  L_{adv}(x) = E_{t,\epsilon} E_{z_t \sim q_t(E_\phi(x))} \|\epsilon_\theta(z_t, t) - \epsilon\|^2_2
  \]

- **Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)**: The iterative process for generating adversarial perturbations is given by:
  \[
  x^{k+1} = P_{B_\infty}(x_0, \delta) x^k + \eta \text{sign} \nabla_{x^k} L_{adv}(x^k)
  \]

- **PDM-Pure Framework**: A proposed method utilizing PDMs as a universal purifier to remove adversarial patterns. The process involves adding noise to protected images and applying the denoising process.

- **Requirements for PDM-Pure**:
  1. The perturbation must exhibit out-of-distribution patterns.
  2. The PDM must be sufficiently strong, determined by the dataset used for training.

- **Performance of PDM-Pure**: Demonstrated superior performance in purifying adversarial patterns compared to existing methods.

- **Implications for Copyright Protection**: Existing protection methods based on adversarial perturbations can be easily bypassed using PDM-based purification, necessitating a reevaluation of these techniques.

- **Experimental Findings**: Extensive experiments show that all tested adversarial attack methods for LDMs fail against PDMs, confirming the robustness of PDMs.

- **Diffusion Process Overview**: The forward diffusion process is defined as:
  \[
  q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = N(x_t; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t I)
  \]
  with the reverse process generating samples from Gaussian noise.

- **Key Contributions**:
  1. Highlighting the oversight in focusing solely on LDMs for adversarial attacks.
  2. Providing empirical evidence of PDMs' robustness.
  3. Introducing PDM-Pure as an effective purification method.
