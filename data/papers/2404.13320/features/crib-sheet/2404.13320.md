- **Key Insight**: Pixel-space diffusion models (PDMs) exhibit significantly higher adversarial robustness compared to latent diffusion models (LDMs) due to their direct operation in pixel space.
  
- **Adversarial Attack Mechanism**: Existing adversarial attacks primarily target LDMs, exploiting their encoder-decoder architecture, which is vulnerable to perturbations. PDMs, however, do not share this vulnerability.

- **Adversarial Loss for LDMs**: The adversarial loss for LDMs is defined as:
  \[
  L_{adv}(x) = E_{t,\epsilon} E_{z_t \sim q_t(E_\phi(x))} \|\epsilon_\theta(z_t, t) - \epsilon\|^2_2
  \]

- **Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)**: The iterative process for generating adversarial perturbations in LDMs is given by:
  \[
  x^{k+1} = P_{B_\infty}(x_0, \delta) + \eta \text{sign} \nabla_{x^k} L_{adv}(x^k)
  \]

- **PDM-Pure Framework**: A proposed method utilizing PDMs as a universal purifier to remove adversarial patterns. The process involves adding noise to protected images and applying the denoising process of a strong PDM.

- **Requirements for PDM-Pure**:
  1. The perturbation must exhibit out-of-distribution patterns.
  2. The PDM must be sufficiently strong, determined by the dataset used for training.

- **Forward Diffusion Process**: The forward diffusion process in PDMs is defined as:
  \[
  q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = N(x_t; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t I)
  \]
  where \(\beta_t\) are pre-defined values.

- **Reverse Denoising Process**: The reverse process is parameterized by a noise estimator \(\epsilon_\theta\) and is trained using the loss:
  \[
  E_{t,x_0,\epsilon}[\lambda(t) \|\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) - \epsilon\|^2]
  \]

- **Experimental Findings**: Extensive experiments show that existing adversarial attack methods for LDMs fail against PDMs, confirming the robustness of PDMs.

- **Implications for Copyright Protection**: The robustness of PDMs complicates the effectiveness of current adversarial perturbation methods used for protecting intellectual property, as they can be easily purified by PDMs.
