  Egocentric, multi-modal data as available on future augmented reality (AR) devices provides unique challenges and opportunities for machine perception. These future devices will need to be all-day wearable in a socially acceptable form-factor to support always available, context-aware and personalized AI applications. Our team at Meta Reality Labs Research built the : An egocentric, multi-modal data recording and streaming device with the goal to foster and accelerate research in this area. In this paper, we describe the hardware including its sensor configuration, the corresponding software tools, and the available machine perception functionalities that make it the ideal tool for egocentric machine perception and contextual AI research.
