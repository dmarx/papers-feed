\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
With \ProjectAria{}, we introduce a new tool for the research community that can capture ecologically valid data as we expect it to be captured by future egocentric devices. We also make available a set of spatial AI machine perception technologies as a foundational building block for higher-level contextualized AI applications.
The data, and derived machine perception results, can provide the foundation for building novel compute and interaction paradigms needed in order to make AR successful and the rich integrated sensor suite provides unique opportunities to explore novel research, applications and use cases in a wide range of areas towards always-on contextualized AI.
