- **Attention Mechanism Bottleneck**: Attention in Transformers has quadratic scaling with sequence length, making it a bottleneck for large language models and long-context applications.

- **FlashAttention Overview**: FlashAttention-2 achieved only 35% utilization on H100 GPUs. FlashAttention-3 aims to improve this by leveraging new hardware capabilities.

- **Key Techniques in FlashAttention-3**:
  - **Asynchrony**: Utilizes asynchronous execution of Tensor Cores and TMA to overlap computation and data movement.
  - **Warp-Specialization**: Implements a producer-consumer model to hide memory and instruction latencies.
  - **Block Quantization**: Adapts low-precision (FP8) processing to minimize quantization error while maximizing throughput.

- **Performance Gains**:
  - **FP16 Performance**: Achieves 1.5-2.0× speedup over FlashAttention-2, reaching up to 740 TFLOPs/s (75% utilization).
  - **FP8 Performance**: Approaches 1.2 PFLOPs/s with 2.6× lower numerical error compared to baseline FP8 attention.

- **Algorithm Structure**:
  - **Forward Pass**: Focuses on a tile of the query matrix, utilizing a circular shared memory buffer for efficient data handling.
  - **Softmax Overlap**: Hides softmax computation under asynchronous block-wise GEMMs to improve efficiency.

- **Memory Hierarchy**:
  - **Global Memory (GMEM)**: Off-chip DRAM accessible to all SMs.
  - **Shared Memory (SMEM)**: On-chip, programmer-managed cache for fast access.
  - **Registers**: Private to each thread, with a maximum of 256 registers.

- **Low-Precision Computation**:
  - **FP8 Tensor Cores**: Targeted for GEMM operations, allowing for nearly double the throughput compared to FP16.
  - **Layout Conformance**: FP8 requires specific memory layouts (k-major) for optimal performance.

- **Numerical Stability in Softmax**: 
  - Scaling factor \( \alpha = \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}} \) is used, and rowmax subtraction is applied to prevent numerical instability.

- **Gradient Computation**:
  - Backward pass gradients are computed using chain rule:
    - \( dV = P^T dO \)
    - \( dK = \alpha dS^T Q \)
    - \( dQ = \alpha dSK \)

- **Open Source Initiative**: FlashAttention-3 is open-sourced with plans for integration into PyTorch and Hugging Face libraries.
