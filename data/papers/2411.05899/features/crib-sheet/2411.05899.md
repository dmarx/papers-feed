- **Bayesian Streaming Inference**: Utilizes Bayes' rule for continuous updates without recomputing posteriors from scratch. Posterior at time \( t \): 
  \[
  p(\theta | y_1, y_2) \propto p(y_2 | \theta) p(y_1 | \theta) p(\theta)
  \]

- **Streaming Bayes GFlowNets (SB-GFlowNets)**: A method for streaming Bayesian inference over discrete parameter spaces, leveraging GFlowNets for efficient sampling.

- **GFlowNets Overview**: A family of amortized variational inference methods for high-dimensional discrete spaces, defined by:
  \[
  G = (G, p_F, p_B, Z)
  \]
  where \( p_F \) is the forward policy and \( p_B \) is the backward policy.

- **Streaming Balance Condition**: 
  \[
  Z_{t+1} p_{F}^{(t+1)}(\tau) = f(D_{t+1} | x) p_{F}^{(t)}(\tau) Z_t p_{B}^{(t)}(\tau | x) p_{B}^{(t+1)}(\tau | x)
  \]
  This condition allows updating without revisiting past data.

- **Loss Function for SB-GFlowNets**: 
  \[
  L_{SB}(G_{t+1}; G_t) = E_{\tau \sim \xi} \left[ \log \frac{Z_{t+1} p_{F}^{(t+1)}(\tau) p_{B}^{(t+1)}(\tau | x)}{p_{B}^{(t)}(\tau | x) Z_t p_{F}^{(t)}(\tau) f(D_{t+1} | x)} \right]
  \]

- **Divergence-Based Updates**: An alternative training criterion that minimizes divergence between forward and backward policies, enhancing approximation quality without relying on estimates of \( Z_t \).

- **Applications**: Demonstrated effectiveness in:
  - **Bayesian Linear Preference Learning**: Efficiently updating preferences with integer-valued features.
  - **Online Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference**: Updating phylogenetic trees as new genetic data is processed.

- **Theoretical Analysis**: Provides upper bounds on approximation errors during posterior propagation, ensuring robustness in streaming updates.

- **Key Contributions**:
  1. Introduction of streaming balance condition for GFlowNets.
  2. Development of divergence-based training algorithms for streaming contexts.
  3. Theoretical bounds on error propagation in streaming Bayesian inference.

  - \( \theta \): Parameters of interest.
  - \( y_i \): Observed data.
