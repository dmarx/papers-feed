\textbf{To-do list (sensitivity analysis):}

    \item Sensitivity analysis for regular trees and uniform distribution 
    \item Generalization for DAGs
    \item Generalization for non-uniform distributions

\textbf{To-do list (policy networks):}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Anonymous
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Balance is impossible for some pairs of pointed DAGs and reward functions
        \item Some characterization of rewards that are particularly hard to approximate
        \item Sequences, Multisets, Anonymous and non-anonymous graphs (directed and undirected) 
\item trade-off between invariances in the networks and built into the state graph    \end{enumerate}
    \item Non-anonymous

\textcolor{red}{
\textbf{To-do list (evaluation and diagnostic of GFLowNets):}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Current evaluation protocols are crap (usually focus on covering modes rather than approximation). Doing the right thing is also computationally infeasible for larges state-spaces 
    \item Convergence diagnostic based on some estimate of $\delta$, leveraging our theorems in the first part of the paper
    \item some diagonose based on, e.g, the estimates we can get from $R$ based on the trajectory-balance loss (in equilibrium, should be path independent, i.e., a constant)
\end{enumerate}
