\begin{abstract}
Creativity is often associated with other markers of distinction, such as genius, imagination or originality.Eminent philosopher Vil√©m Flusser says "Only one who writes lines can think logically, calculate, criticize, pursue knowledge, philosophize.". Researchers have demonstrated that the current pile of large language models can  not only write academic essays, emails, cover letters but even poetry, fiction or screenplays. Unlike other forms of writing, creative writing places a much higher value on doing unexpected things that confound and delight the reader, typically contradicting the auto-regressive nature of LLMs. In spite of this there has been substantial discussion at the intersection of AI and creative writing, especially with researchers from Open-AI stating that creative writers and authors have extraordinarily high "exposure" to disruption from AI tools \cite{eloundou2023gpts}. Creativity is often difficult to evaluate because it is a complex, multifaceted concept that is deeply subjective, contextual, and hard to judge objectively. To tackle this, we interview 8 creative writing experts to elicit measures for evaluating creative writing. These measures are grounded in existing theoretical research on cognitive psychology for measuring creativity. We then recruit creative writing experts to utilize these measures to evaluate stories written by LLM's vs professional writers on the same plot. Our results show concerning trends that LLM generated stories are often of much poorer quality across several dimensions of creativity when compared to those written by professional writers. Additionally we also show that experts can easily identify stories written by AI vs those by professional writers. We also simulate the same evaluation using LLMs, demonstrating significant disagreement with creative writing experts thereby suggesting that LLMs are not aligned with expert humans across judgments about creativity.
