Large Language models have been shown to automatically generate long and coherent stories \cite{yang2022doc,yang2022re3} as well as act as collaborators for creative writing \cite{yuan2022wordcraft,ippolito2022creative,mirowski2023cowriting}. However, there have been fewer studies showing how LLM-generated stories differ from expert written stories on metrics that are more fine-grained and objective.Our investigation involves an analysis of a dozen narratives authored by humans, as detailed in Table \ref{teststories}, extracted from The New Yorker. These narratives span a variety of esteemed authors, ranging from \textit{Haruki Murakami} to Nobel laureate \textit{Annie Ernaux}. The protocol for our human assessment incorporates two primary components: 

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \itemsep0em 
    \item Absolute evaluation of creative writing, disregarding whether it has been composed by a human or a LLM
    \item Relative evaluation for discerning whether a story has been produced by a human or an LLM( Turing Test).
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure*}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/datapipeline.pdf}
\caption{\label{datapipeline}Pipeline showing how our test set is created for evaluation. For each human-written original NewYorker story, we generate 3 stories from one LLM each, based on the plot of the original story. The plot is a single-sentence summary of the original story automatically generated by GPT-4 and verified by humans.}
\end{figure*}


In order to allow relative evaluation each human-authored narrative is summarized into a single-sentence plot, which is further verified by human evaluators. We then prompt three LLMs: GPT3.5, GPT4, and Claude, to generate a story conditioned on this plot summary. This yields a total of 48 short narratives for absolute evaluation (12 human written; 36 LLM written). Following this, we assign four stories centered around a single plot (one human-authored versus three LLM-authored) to a singular cluster, culminating in a total of 12 clusters. The methodology for creating an individual cluster is illustrated in Figure \ref{datapipeline}. The decision to employ human-authored plot summaries to prompt the LLMs is informed by the recognized shortfall of LLMs in their ability to devise original plotlines, as highlighted in previous research \cite{ippolito2022creative}. Furthermore, the utilization of multiple stories derived from the same plot enables experts to concentrate specifically on the human aspects of creative writing, and enhances their capacity to distinguish human-generated content from AI-produced ones.

In our quest to prevent straightforward parameters from differentiating between stories penned by human authors versus those produced by artificial intelligence (AI), we implemented strategies to ensure comparable story lengths across both classes. Initial experimentation revealed a notable discrepancy: Large Language Models (LLMs), when instructed to generate narratives of a predetermined word count, consistently underperformed, resulting in stories that were invariably more concise than intended. To address this inconsistency, we employed an iterative mechanism, prompting the LLM to iteratively rewrite the initial story until the divergence in word count between the AI-generated and human-composed story was less than 200 for every cluster. Table \ref{promptstory} (Row1) shows the original story prompt, while (Row2) illustrates the subsequent instruction to rewrite the story. We start the iterative process by prompting the LLM to expand the initially generated story. This cycle continued until the narrative length reached the pre-specified threshold or when the iteration count exceeded twenty ($loop\_count > $20). This methodology ensured the creation of AI-written stories with length characteristics more akin to those produced by human authors.
