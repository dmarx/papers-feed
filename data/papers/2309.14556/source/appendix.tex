Table \ref{teststories} shows the data used for conducting our evaluation. The 12 stories shown are taken from The New Yorker and summarized into single-sentence plots. These stories come from highly established literary experts acting as an upper bound for what it means to be creative. These stories span complex themes.

\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Write a New Yorker-style story given the plot below. Make sure it is atleast \textbf{\color{blue}\{\{word\_count\}\}} words.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
E5 & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}It was a pretty effective rubric! I'm used to being more subjective in my work -- did you like a story? Did it connect with \\you? Did it make sense? Why or why not? It was often challenging to break it down into more regimented segments \\like the rubric asked for -- but I do think that it allowed me to express the subjective feelings in a pretty thorough and\\ structured way!\end{tabular}                                                                                                                                                                 \\ \hline
E3 & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}As for the rubric, I thought it was quite thorough. There were some categories where I would say the story didn’t ``pass,"\\ but which were excellent. This happened often with the categories about multiple points of view, and innovative\\ structure and form. Overall, I think the rubric was helpful in helping me think about the different aspects of storytelling.\end{tabular}                                                                                                                                                                                 \\ \hline
E4 & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}I thought the rubric felt pretty thorough; the only part I felt could be added was that suggestion about consistency in\\ voice \& diction!\end{tabular}                                                                                                                                                         \\ \hline
E2 & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}The rubric seemed great to me! It’s however hard to talk about something like pacing without talking about scene and \\summary, for instance. Or the difference between originality of thought and originality in theme/content—wouldn’t the \\latter make up the former and vice/versa? But it is also comprehensive and I can see the merits of this sort of repetition in\\ teasing out a fuller picture of things\end{tabular} \\ \hline
E1 & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}I thought the rubric was pretty good tbh. I think there is overlap in some of the different elements, like "language \\proficiency \& literary devices" and "originality in thought." it's tricky to use words like "satisfying" and "sophisticated" \\when assessing art, but there's always going to be a great deal of subjectivity in these matters.I think that voice is a crucial \\aspect of high-quality writing that is being overlooked by the rubric, and one that greatly informs how I as a reader\\ evaluate 
and appreciate literary writing.\end{tabular} \\ \hline

Since the experts listed in Table \ref{creativeexperts} were not involved in designing the rubric but evaluated several stories based on the rubric we asked them their \textit{overall thought about the rubric and any potentially crucial test we missed out on that they use to discriminate between good and bad writing}.As can be seen in Table \ref{expertfeedbackrubric} in Appendix overall almost every expert agreed on the thorough and effective nature of our rubric. Many of them agreed on the fact that our rubric helped them to think about different aspects of storytelling in a more structured way. One of the difficult things about coming up with a rubric for creativity is ensuring coverage. Even though our rubric covers most aspects of creative writing, some experts such as E1 and E4 emphasized on the utility of \textbf{Consistency of Voice and Diction} as a measurable test. In E4's words \textit{``Inconsistent voice and diction are sometimes/often notable in stories that aren't very good, and when voice \& diction are used beautifully, it enhances a story considerably"}. E1 similarly exclaimed \textit{``One of the most meaningful aspects of high-quality literary writing is voice, which conveys qualities of proficiency, artistry, personality, and identity."}. We hope future work can adapt this as a meaningful test in addition to the tests covered in our rubric. Finally, some of the tests from our rubric can have potential overlaps as pointed out by E2. This is further corroborated by the similar numbers for \textit{Narrative Pacing} and \textit{Scenes vs Exposition} suggesting a strong correlation between the two.

\subsection{Common themes in TTCW of Originality and Elaboration}


Table~\ref{expertexpl2} provides common themes and issues found in the expert explanations for each TTCW in the Originality and Elaboration dimensions.


\subsection{Example LLM-generated and expert-written explanations for a TTCW assessment} 

\input{tables/llm_vs_expert_explanations}

In Table~\ref{llmvsexpertexpl}, we show examples of explanations that experts wrote in conjunction with a binary TTCW assessment they made on a story, as well as the corresponding LLM-generated explanations.

\subsection{Can non-experts administer TTCW tests?}

Recruiting experts for data annotation purposes is challenging, and costly, and must consider the time constraint put on the experts. Prior work has shown the potential of crowd-sourcing (through platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk) and the ability of non-experts to accomplish complex tasks as a crowd \cite{kittur2013future}, when following an appropriate workflow that iterates and validates the work on individual non-experts. Some prior work has even shown the validity of crowd-based feedback for writing tasks \cite{bernstein2010soylent,nebeling2016wearwrite}. 

In this work, we chose to rely on experts for annotation, to maximize the validity of our experiments, and confirm whether experts with domain knowledge would reach satisfying agreement levels when evaluating stories with TTCW. Future work can leverage our open-sourced annotations to explore whether non-experts correlate with experts when performing TTCW evaluation, which could lead to more cost-effective TTCW evaluation.
