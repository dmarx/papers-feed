E5 & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}\textbf{\color{blue}The AI rarely knew how to end a story} -- it would get bigger \& bigger in scope, leaving the characters behind \& talking\\ about their legacy and the community and the world at large. \textbf{\color{ForestGreen}Whenever the AI attempted metaphor or comparison, it}\\ \textbf{\color{ForestGreen}typically fell flat, with nonsensical analogies}. And it often didn't have a strong grasp on narrative structure; \textbf{\color{orange}characters} \\  \textbf{\color{orange}would sometimes appear without warning and then disappear without having any impact on the story itself}. The \\AI clearly knows the different elements of a story but doesn't have a grasp on how to merge them into a satisfying narrative.\end{tabular}                                                                                        \\ \hline
E3 & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}The story tends to use vague or cliched language, often repetitively. \textbf{\color{purple}Some words or phrases tended to be used again}\\ \textbf{\color{purple}and again over multiple stories for example ``\textit{inky sky},”  repeated a lot, as did ``\textit{etched}"}. There were parts that did not \\make sense over the course of the story. \textbf{\color{orange}A character might do something or think something in the beginning,}\\ \textbf{\color{orange}and then do something later that was contradictory or didn’t make sense}. Some of them were wildly trippy, like some\\ kind of surreal dream, in which nothing made sense.\textbf{\color{brown}The stories would spiral into a repetitive pattern, where the same}\\\textbf{\color{brown} things happened}, and the actions were described in similar ways. \textbf{\color{brown}It was as if the writer got stuck and just kept }\\ \textbf{\color{brown}repeating the same things}. This happened often when long periods of time passed.\end{tabular}                                                                                                                                                                      \\ \hline\hline
E4 & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}\textbf{\color{ForestGreen}Stories have over-modified descriptions but when AI does it, it's often followed by otherwise heightened diction} \\ in a way that human writing isn't. Sometimes, human writers will experiment with different syntax within their stories, but \\ I'd say, in my experience, it's somewhat rare. AI writing on the other hand demonstrated unusual/inconsistent syntax.Some\\ of the stories I believed were \textbf{\color{blue}AI-written had this weird forestalling of the ending}, which *could* happen with a novice \\ writer, for sure, but it didn't feel to me like a narrative choice a human writer would make. After the climax of the  story, \\\textbf{\color{blue}the falling action falls...and falls...and then just plateaus until the thing finally ends}\end{tabular}                                                                                                  \\ \hline\hline
E1 & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}\textbf{\color{ForestGreen}AI written sentences would be a series of words, positioned in a grammatically-correct fashion, with superficial}  \\ \textbf{\color{ForestGreen} shape that we associate with figurative language - but it just doesn't mean anything}. Figurative language adds \\meaning and context. It might be confusing, or poorly done, but there is always some idea being expressed in a non-literal\\ fashion. I've noticed that we, as real people, often answer questions in roundabout ways or ways that don't directly address \\the initial query. This brings a level of implied meaning or subtext to our conversations that hint at emotions and relationship\\ dynamics, something is often seen in high-quality fiction. However, \textbf{\color{red}I find AI-written dialogues disappointingly lacking}\\ \textbf{\color{red} in subtext}.They rely heavily on direct \& expositional dialogue, which feels decidedly unnatural \& less human. AI \textbf{\color{orange}characters}\\\textbf{\color{orange} frequently } \textbf{\color{orange} over-explain situations and emotions, resulting in an unrealistic portrayal of human interactions.}\\ Expert storytelling requires a nuanced understanding of reader engagement and artistic skill that amateur writers often \\lack, typically due to limited exposure to literature. This results in stories heavy in exposition and \textbf{\color{red}lacking in subtext}. AI\\-written stories take these issues to another level, often including random, incoherent elements and repeated pet phrases or\\ words.\textbf{\color{blue}These quirks become more} \textbf{\color{blue}noticeable over time, especially when AI attempts multiple disparate endings.}\\
Then consider the literal coherence of the stories. The definitely-AI ones would do random things \textbf{\color{orange}like introduce 'terrible }\\\textbf{\color{orange}beasts" who exist in the story for half a}\textbf{\color{orange} paragraph for some reason, and then just disappear.}
\textbf{\color{purple}There are also little}\\\textbf{\color{purple} pet phrases and words that repeat in the}\textbf{\color{purple}stories I am positive came from AI : a lot of "tendrils" and "inky}\\ \textbf{\color{purple}darkness."} And especially, a specific sentence construction of [time-orienting clause] [comma] [exposition].``\textit{In the days}\\\textit{that followed, X became a legend because Y.}" The same way authors have identifiable style and voice, so does AI.

E2 & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}It seemed like there were two AI models that were generating stories for each batch. I feel like I began to notice and read\\ them as I would read or notice works by the same writer. \textbf{\color{brown} One would rapidly accelerate through time after the first}\\ \textbf{\color{brown} scene or so, probably once it was loose from the parameters it had been fed.}These accelerations were broadly pretty\\ absurd and hysterical. The other was a bit more subtle, but would \textbf{\color{blue}consistently end its stories  abruptly and employ}\\\textbf{\color{blue} somewhat bizarre logic}. In both cases, the \textbf{\color{red} AI seemed entirely unable to use implication or subtext}  \textbf{\color{ForestGreen}and its use of,}\\ \textbf{\color{ForestGreen} images, metaphors, etc was always very simple.}
