\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Originality in\\ Thought\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Fresh language, unique plot and characters, subtle\\ emotional resonance, and inventive metaphors.

\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Originality in\\ Theme/Content\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Unconventional, dreamlike exploration of emotions\\ such as love and loss, evoking empathy and reflection\\ through its distinct main character perspective, \\ eschewing simplistic meanings for ambiguity, and \\ valuing open-ended questions over singular messages,\\ thus providing a unique reading experience compared\\ to conventional stories.\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Disjointed narrative, underdeveloped themes, \\ inconsistent tone, vaguely defined characters, and\\ abrupt context shifts, lack depth and fail to provide \\ substantive insight or originality to the reader.\end{tabular} \\ \hline\hline
