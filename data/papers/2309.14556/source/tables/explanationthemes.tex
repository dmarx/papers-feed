Test & Passing Stories & Failing Stories \\ \hline
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Understandability \\ \& Coherence\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Logical sequences, Interconnected details,\\ Rich character development, consistent\\ tone, Surprising yet earned conclusions, \\ Internal consistency in atmosphere and\\ symbolism\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Jumpy timelines, Unsatisfying endings, Undeveloped \\ plot points, Contradictory details, Illogical events, \\ Rambling prose, No overarching focus, Disjointed \\ Transition, Unclear Narration, Clichéd elements,\\ Inconsistent characterization\end{tabular} \\ \hline
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Language \\ Proficiency \\ \& Literary \\Devices\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Utilize literary devices sparingly and directly,\\ enhancing the narratives that primarily draw \\ their strength from characterization and plot \\ rather than from highly figurative language.\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Attempts at figurative language come across as \\ overwrought, confusing, nonsensical. Subtlety and\\ restraint seem lacking, and the language choices \\ more often obscure rather than illuminate.\end{tabular} \\ \hline
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Narrative\\ Pacing\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Adeptly manage time and pacing, varying \\ narrative rhythm, employing economic \\ language, skillfully transitioning between past\\ and present, creating suspense, mood, and interest\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Abrupt, jarring shifts in time or scene.Pacing that's\\ too slow/fast without purpose. Overly long descri-\\ ptions or passages. Events feeling randomly \\ ordered or disconnected\end{tabular} \\ \hline
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Narrative\\ Ending\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Resolutions that weave earlier themes and\\ character perspectives into surprising yet \\ inevitable endings, leaving room for \\ interpretation\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Abrupt or unearned resolutions, overly moralistic \\ conclusions, unrealistic happy endings, unresolved \\ story threads, forced theme statements, narrative \\ disconnect, and unexpected surreal elements.\end{tabular} \\ \hline
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Scene vs\\ Exposition\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Strategic balance of vivid scenes and concise \\ summaries, complementing each other to \\ enhance the narrative flow and reader experience\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Overreliance on summary leaves the narrative \\ ungrounded.Abrupt shifts between the two modes \\ prove confusing. Brief, underdeveloped scenes\\ fail to impact the reader.Overwrought scene \\ description obfuscates rather than illuminates\end{tabular} \\ \hline\hline
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Emotional\\ Flexibility\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Harmonize interiority and exteriority, using \\ well-crafted transitions and narrative techniques\\ to convey character's inner states and external\\ actions, thereby fostering a deep connection\\ with the protagonist\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Unclear distinction between inner and outer realities, \\ Unrefined interior thoughts, insufficient external \\ grounding, cliched abstract language, an indistinct \\ mix of memory and metaphor with the present,\\ and underdeveloped character inner lives.\end{tabular} \\ \hline
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Perspective\\ \& Voice\\ Flexibility\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Convincing \& diverse perspectives where \\ authors employ techniques such as nuanced \\ character development, authentic voice \\ crafting, detail-oriented storytelling, \&\\ efficient implication of perspectives, ensuring\\ a delicate balance between relatable \& \\ unlikeable traits\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Narrator's perspective dominates, and the other \\ characters are not portrayed convincingly as full human\\ beings with distinct viewpoints. While there are\\ some interesting moments, overall the story lacks truly\\ diverse perspectives that feel authentic and human.\end{tabular} \\ \hline
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Structural\\ Flexibility\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Effective narrative turns that were surprising yet \\ believable, enhancing story depth, matching \\ themes and characters, increasing complexity\\ and stakes, aligning with the story’s style and \\ voice, and providing answers to previously raised\\ questions.\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Turns and surprises are ineffective, random, or\\ nonsensical rather than purposeful or appropriate.\\ While some stories sparked interest with an unusual\\ premise or relationship, they often failed to deliver \\ on the potential\end{tabular} \\ \hline
