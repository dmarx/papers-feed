We introduced \implname, a novel blueprint toward realizing self-adaptive LLMs. 
We first proposed \svdacro, offering superior performance, reduced costs, high compositionality, and overfitting regularization. 
Building on \svdacro experts, we developed three effective self-adaptation strategies, each providing unique benefits and scalable performance improvements. 
Future work could explore cross-model compatibility and expert skill recycling across model generations, drawing from recent model merging techniques~\citep{yu2024language,goddard2024arcee,akiba2024evolutionary} to overcome individual LLM limitations.
