- **Main Thesis**: Adversarial perturbations in style mimicry protections do not reliably safeguard artists from generative AI misuse.
  
- **Key Protections Evaluated**:
  - **Glaze**: Perturbs images to disrupt style mimicry by targeting the encoder in latent diffusion models.
  - **Mist**: Similar to Glaze, also targets the encoder.
  - **Anti-DreamBooth**: Targets the denoiser to maximize prediction error on perturbed images.

- **Robust Mimicry Methods**: 
  - Low-effort techniques (e.g., Gaussian noise addition, different finetuning scripts) can effectively bypass existing protections.
  - Multi-step strategies combining off-the-shelf tools yield indistinguishable results from unprotected artworks.

- **User Study Findings**: All tested protections were easily bypassed, demonstrating that they provide a false sense of security for artists.

- **Limitations of Current Protections**:
  - Protections do not generalize across different finetuning setups.
  - Existing evaluations often use outdated models or low-resolution images, leading to inaccurate assessments of protection effectiveness.
  - Reliance on automated metrics (e.g., CLIP similarity) is unreliable for measuring style mimicry.

- **Proposed Evaluation Protocol**: 
  - A unified evaluation framework to assess protections against a variety of robust mimicry methods.
  - Use of a popular off-the-shelf finetuning script for the strongest open-source model (Stable Diffusion 2.1) to ensure comprehensive testing.

- **Robust Mimicry Methods Developed**:
  1. **Noisy Upscaling**: Combines Gaussian noise addition with upscaling to remove protections.
  2. **Off-the-shelf Finetuning**: Utilizes readily available scripts to finetune models on protected images.
  3. **Adversarial Purification**: Techniques like DiffPure can effectively remove perturbations.
  4. **IMPRESS-inspired Method**: A white-box approach that builds on previous purification methods.

- **Conclusion**: Current adversarial machine learning techniques are insufficient for protecting artists; alternative protective measures are urgently needed.
