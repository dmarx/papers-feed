\subsection{Artificial tasks}

Many tasks have been proposed which aim to probe the compositionality capabilities of neural networks. Following \citet{Hupkes2020Compositionality} these can be structured into \textbf{Arithmetic Language and Mathematical Reasoning} \cite{Veldhoen2016DiagnosticClassifiers, Hupkes2018Visualisation, Saxton2019AnalysingMath}
% \citet{Hupkes2020Compositionality} provide an overview of tasks aiming to probe the compositionality capability of neural networks. They include artificial tasks
