Hyperbolic embeddings embed hierarchical information with high
fidelity and few dimensions. We explored the limits of this approach
by describing scalable, high quality algorithms. We hope the
techniques here encourage more follow-on work on the exciting
techniques of \citet{fb, ucl}. As future work, we hope to explore how
hyperbolic embeddings can be most effectively incorporated into downstream
tasks and applications.
