- **Dense Vision Transformer (DPT)**: An architecture that replaces convolutional networks with vision transformers for dense prediction tasks, maintaining high-resolution representations throughout processing stages.

- **Key Advantages**:
  - **Global Receptive Field**: Every stage of the transformer has a global receptive field, allowing for fine-grained and coherent predictions.
  - **Constant Dimensionality**: Unlike convolutional networks, DPT maintains a constant dimensionality of representations, avoiding loss of feature granularity.

- **Architecture Overview**:
  - **Encoder-Decoder Structure**: DPT follows a traditional encoder-decoder design, where the encoder is based on a vision transformer (ViT).
  - **Token Representation**: Image patches are embedded into tokens, which are processed through multiple transformer layers.

- **Transformer Encoder**:
  - **Multi-Headed Self-Attention (MHSA)**: Each token can attend to all other tokens, enhancing the representation's contextual understanding.
  - **Patch Size**: Utilizes non-overlapping square patches of size \( p^2 \) pixels for embedding.

- **Reassemble Operation**:
  - **Function**: \( Reassemble_D^s(t) = (Resample_s \circ Concatenate \circ Read)(t) \)
  - **Read Variants**:
    - \( Read\_ignore(t) \): Ignores the readout token.
    - \( Read\_add(t) \): Adds the readout token to all other tokens.
    - \( Read\_proj(t) \): Concatenates the readout token with others before projecting.

- **Convolutional Decoder**: 
  - Assembles tokens into image-like representations at various resolutions, progressively fusing them into final dense predictions.

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Monocular Depth Estimation**: Achieved a performance increase of over 28% compared to state-of-the-art fully-convolutional networks.
  - **Semantic Segmentation**: Set a new state of the art on ADE20K with 49.02% mIoU.

- **Fine-Tuning Capability**: DPT can be fine-tuned on smaller datasets (e.g., NYUv2, KITTI, Pascal Context) while still achieving state-of-the-art results.

- **Experimental Results**: Demonstrated substantial improvements in dense prediction tasks, particularly with large training datasets.

- **Model Availability**: The models are accessible at [GitHub - Intel ISL DPT](https://github.com/intel-isl/DPT).
