- **Diffusion as Shader (DaS)**: A novel 3D-aware video diffusion model that utilizes 3D tracking videos as control signals for versatile video generation tasks.
  
- **Key Insight**: Achieving precise video control requires leveraging 3D control signals, as videos are 2D renderings of dynamic 3D content.

- **3D Tracking Videos**: These videos contain motion trajectories of 3D points, linking frames effectively and enhancing temporal consistency in generated videos.

- **Control Tasks Supported by DaS**:
  1. **Animating Meshes to Videos**: Transforms animated 3D meshes into 3D tracking videos for high-quality video generation.
  2. **Camera Control**: Uses depth maps to extract 3D points projected onto a camera path, enabling customized camera movements.
  3. **Motion Transfer**: Synthesizes new videos by following the motion of original videos, utilizing 3D tracking for accurate motion capture.
  4. **Object Manipulation**: Integrates object segmentation and depth estimation to manipulate specific objects in the video.

- **Data Efficiency**: DaS can be fine-tuned with less than 10k videos on 8 H800 GPUs in 3 days, demonstrating strong control capabilities.

- **Performance Comparison**: DaS outperforms baseline methods in camera control and motion transfer tasks, showcasing superior generation quality in mesh-to-video and object manipulation.

- **Temporal Consistency**: The use of 3D tracking videos ensures consistent appearances for the same 3D points across frames, even when regions temporarily disappear and reappear.

- **Related Works**: 
  - **Controllable Video Generation**: Existing methods focus on specific control types, while DaS offers a unified architecture for multiple control tasks.
  - **Video Diffusion Models**: Previous models have shown success in video generation but lacked the versatility and precision that DaS provides.
