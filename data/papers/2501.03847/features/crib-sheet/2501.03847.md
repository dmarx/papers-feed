- **Diffusion as Shader (DaS)**: A novel 3D-aware video diffusion model that utilizes 3D tracking videos as control signals for versatile video generation tasks.
  
- **Key Insight**: Achieving precise video control requires leveraging 3D control signals, as videos are 2D renderings of dynamic 3D content.

- **3D Tracking Videos**: These videos contain motion trajectories of 3D points, allowing for enhanced temporal consistency and linking frames effectively.

- **Control Tasks Supported by DaS**:
  - **Mesh-to-Video Generation**: Transforms animated 3D meshes into high-quality videos.
  - **Camera Control**: Enables customized camera movements by projecting 3D points onto specified camera paths.
  - **Motion Transfer**: Synthesizes new videos by following the motion of original videos using 3D tracking.
  - **Object Manipulation**: Allows for precise control of object movements by integrating segmentation techniques with depth estimation.

- **Data Efficiency**: DaS can be fine-tuned with less than 10k videos on 8 H800 GPUs in just 3 days, demonstrating strong control capabilities.

- **Temporal Consistency**: The use of 3D tracking videos ensures consistent appearances for the same 3D points across frames, improving coherence even when objects temporarily disappear.

- **Comparison with Baselines**: DaS shows significantly improved performance in camera control and motion transfer tasks compared to existing methods.

- **Related Works**: 
  - **Controllable Video Generation**: Previous methods focused on specific control types, while DaS offers a unified approach for multiple control tasks.
  - **Existing Models**: Notable models include VDM, SVD, Sora, and CogVideo-X, which have shown strong performance in video generation but lack the versatility of DaS.
