A template for reports and papers from Google DeepMind.

Use the file deepmind-test.tex as an example file.
You can also find the these instructions online.

=== What You Include in Your Project Directory
You new LaTeX project needs to include two things from this repository:
 * googledeepmind.cls - where the actual style is defined.
 * assets/ folder, which contains the Google DeepMind logo, which is needed if you use the logo option of the style file.
 * [Optional] defns.tex A useful set of macros that provide a set of useful commands for bold mathematical symbols (for vectors and matrices) and other common mathematical and stylistic shortcuts.

=== Template Options
Using the template is easy: simply set the documentclass of your document to googledeepmind.
\documentclass[11pt, a4paper, other_options]{googledeepmind}

The other options available are:
 * twocolumn: Makes the paper into two column mode; single column by default.
 * logo: Adds the DeepMind logo to the top left. No logo included if this option is left out.
 * address: Add our postal address for correspondence to the bottom footer.
 * copyright: Add a copyright statement to the first page of the paper in the left footnote
 * nonumbering: Use un-numbered sections; letters to Nature/Science don’t have numbered sections, so author-copies of these papers will use this options. Sections are numbered by default.
 * internal: Add a note on every page that the document is confidential and should not be shared externally. Can only include the technical report number with this option.

Best to always include these options 11pt and a4paper:
 * 11pt: Sets the normal font size of the text. Can be only 10, 11, 12pt.
 * a4paper: Paper size. Usually would not adjust.

=== Keyword Commands
There are a few keyword commands that you can add to the preamble of the document to set the date of the paper, keywords, paper url, and the report number.

Corresponding author(s)
If you would like to include the email addresses for corresponding author(s), the include the command
\correspondingauthor{your-email-address-here}, which will include it at the bottom-left on the first page.
You can comment or leave this out if not needed.

Date 
By default, the paper will include the current date at which it is compiled at the top right. You will probably want to use a fixed date, the example has the date fixed to 2000-01-01 (we suggest using ISO-8601 format). To do this add the command \renewcommand{today}{Your date}

Keywords
Specify any keywords using the \keywords{your keywords here}. If you don’t want to have any keywords, then you can leave the command out.

Paper URL
If you have a paper url---to the deepmind site, the publishers site, or arxiv---then add your url using the command \paperurl{my.url.com}. You can comment or leave this out if not needed.

Report Number
To use this make sure to add the option `internal' to the document class.
All internal reports are given a technical report number that is assigned to the paper. If you have one, then you can add to the paper using \reportnumber{555}, which will add the report number to the bottom of every page. Must have the `internal` option to see this. You can comment or leave this out if not needed.
