                   Average Lagging for Simultaneous Speech Translation},
  year =          {2022},
  abstract =      {Simultaneous speech translation (SimulST) systems aim
                   at generating their output with the lowest possible
                   latency, which is normally computed in terms of
                   Average Lagging (AL). In this paper we highlight
                   that, despite its widespread adoption, AL provides
                   underestimated scores for systems that generate
                   longer predictions compared to the corresponding
                   references. We also show that this problem has
                   practical relevance, as recent SimulST systems have
                   indeed a tendency to over-generate. As a solution, we
                   propose LAAL (Length-Adaptive Average Lagging), a
                   modified version of the metric that takes into
                   account the over-generation phenomenon and allows for
                   unbiased evaluation of both under-/over-generating
                   systems.},

  abstract =      {Most sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are
                   autoregressive; they generate each token by
                   conditioning on previously generated tokens. In
                   contrast, non-autoregressive seq2seq models generate
                   all tokens in one pass, which leads to increased
                   efficiency through parallel processing on hardware
                   such as GPUs. However, directly modeling the joint
                   distribution of all tokens simultaneously is
                   challenging, and even with increasingly complex model
                   structures accuracy lags significantly behind
                   autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a
                   simple, efficient, and effective model for
                   non-autoregressive sequence generation using latent
                   variable models. Specifically, we turn to generative
                   flow, an elegant technique to model complex
                   distributions using neural networks, and design
                   several layers of flow tailored for modeling the
                   conditional density of sequential latent variables.
                   We evaluate this model on three neural machine
                   translation (NMT) benchmark datasets, achieving
                   comparable performance with state-of-the-art
                   non-autoregressive NMT models and almost constant
                   decoding time w.r.t the sequence length.},

                   Degeneration in Language Models},
  year =          {2020},
  abstract =      {Pretrained neural language models (LMs) are prone to
                   generating racist, sexist, or otherwise toxic
                   language which hinders their safe deployment. We
                   investigate the extent to which pretrained LMs can be
                   prompted to generate toxic language, and the
                   effectiveness of controllable text generation
                   algorithms at preventing such toxic degeneration. We
                   create and release RealToxicityPrompts, a dataset of
                   100K naturally occurring, sentence-level prompts
                   derived from a large corpus of English web text,
                   paired with toxicity scores from a widely-used
                   toxicity classifier. Using RealToxicityPrompts, we
                   find that pretrained LMs can degenerate into toxic
                   text even from seemingly innocuous prompts. We
                   empirically assess several controllable generation
                   methods, and find that while data- or
                   compute-intensive methods (e.g., adaptive pretraining
                   on non-toxic data) are more effective at steering
                   away from toxicity than simpler solutions (e.g.,
                   banning {``}bad{''} words), no current method is
                   failsafe against neural toxic degeneration. To
                   pinpoint the potential cause of such persistent toxic
                   degeneration, we analyze two web text corpora used to
                   pretrain several LMs (including GPT-2; Radford et.
                   al, 2019), and find a significant amount of
                   offensive, factually unreliable, and otherwise toxic
                   content. Our work provides a test bed for evaluating
                   toxic generations by LMs and stresses the need for
                   better data selection processes for pretraining.},

  abstract =      {Neural machine translation has significantly pushed
                   forward the quality of the field. However, there are
                   remaining big issues with the output translations and
                   one of them is fairness. Neural models are trained on
                   large text corpora which contain biases and
                   stereotypes. As a consequence, models inherit these
                   social biases. Recent methods have shown results in
                   reducing gender bias in other natural language
                   processing tools such as word embeddings. We take
                   advantage of the fact that word embeddings are used
                   in neural machine translation to propose a method to
                   equalize gender biases in neural machine translation
                   using these representations. Specifically, we
                   propose, experiment and analyze the integration of
                   two debiasing techniques over GloVe embeddings in the
                   Transformer translation architecture. We evaluate our
                   proposed system on the WMT English-Spanish benchmark
                   task, showing gains up to one BLEU point. As for the
                   gender bias evaluation, we generate a test set of
                   occupations and we show that our proposed system
                   learns to equalize existing biases from the baseline
                   system.},
