\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Cao~\etal~\cite{cao2023impress} recently proposed a purification-based method (IMPRESS) to 
remove Glaze protection~\cite{shan2023glaze} that are designed to protect art
styles from AI mimicry. We first summarize how Glaze and IMPRESS work in \S\ref{sec:back}. 
Then we show IMPRESS achieve limited effectiveness against
Glaze in a variety of real-world mimicry scenarios. In short:

\begin{packed_itemize}
\item IMPRESS has weaker performance on artists who are not historical
  artists already with a large presence in the pretrained models;

\item IMPRESS works poorly on smooth surface art styles (\eg realism);

\item IMPRESS damages image quality even for clean images. 

\end{packed_itemize}
