\section{Discussion and Limitations}
\label{sec:discussion}

Our work provides a first step to addressing the rising challenge of style
mimicry through training data extracted from video imagery. However, we note
that this work still has significant limitations.

First, we note that our work primarily targets and addresses the
pixel-averaging adaptive attack. Given time, it is entirely possible for new
distinct adaptive attacks to arise in the video mimicry space that \system{}
is not designed to mitigate. Similarly, it is also possible that effective
countermeasures will be identified which target \system{} itself beyond the
scene-splitting attack. Second, while \system{} reduces computation costs
significantly over a naive application of anti-mimicry tools to each frame,
the resulting computation is still quite significant, and likely remains out
of reach for smaller video or animation creators.  Finally, it is possible
that image mimicry attacks might be supplanted altogether by some form of
video mimicry attack in the future. Such risks and potential mitigation
methods might become more clear as we learn more about generative video
models and their training process.
