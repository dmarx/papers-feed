  abstract: 'A crucial task in the analysis of on-line social-networking systems is
    to

    identify important people --- those linked by strong social ties --- within an

    individual''s network neighborhood. Here we investigate this question for a

    particular category of strong ties, those involving spouses or romantic

    partners. We organize our analysis around a basic question: given all the

    connections among a person''s friends, can you recognize his or her romantic

    partner from the network structure alone? Using data from a large sample of

    Facebook users, we find that this task can be accomplished with high accuracy,

    but doing so requires the development of a new measure of tie strength that we

    term `dispersion'' --- the extent to which two people''s mutual friends are not

    themselves well-connected. The results offer methods for identifying types of

    structurally significant people in on-line applications, and suggest a

    potential expansion of existing theories of tie strength.'

    This paper is a systematic comparison of models that learn such

    representations to be used in supervised systems, but shallow log-linear models

    work best for building representation spaces that can be decoded with simple

    filters, and (3) with different domain compositions. First, we quantify the

    effect of pretraining data age. A temporal shift between evaluation data and

    finetuning. Second, we explore the effect of quality and toxicity filters,

    showing a trade-off between performance on standard benchmarks and risk of

    one-size-fits-all solution to filtering training data. We also find that the

    characteristics. Lastly, we empirically validate that the inclusion of

    heterogeneous data sources, like books and web, is broadly beneficial and

    warrants greater prioritization. These findings constitute the largest set of

  abstract: 'Scaling laws are useful guides for derisking expensive training runs,
    as they

    predict performance of large models using cheaper, small-scale experiments.

    However, there remain gaps between current scaling studies and how language

    models are ultimately trained and evaluated. For instance, scaling is usually

    studied in the compute-optimal training regime (i.e., "Chinchilla optimal"

    regime). In contrast, models are often over-trained to reduce inference costs.

    Moreover, scaling laws mostly predict loss on next-token prediction, but models

    are usually compared on downstream task performance. To address both

    shortcomings, we create a testbed of 104 models with 0.011B to 6.9B parameters

    trained with various numbers of tokens on three data distributions. First, we

    fit scaling laws that extrapolate in both the amount of over-training and the

    number of model parameters. This enables us to predict the validation loss of
    a

    1.4B parameter, 900B token run (i.e., 32$\times$ over-trained) and a 6.9B

    parameter, 138B token run (i.e., a compute-optimal run)$\unicode{x2014}$each

    from experiments that take 300$\times$ less compute. Second, we relate the

    perplexity of a language model to its downstream task performance by proposing

    a power law. We use this law to predict top-1 error averaged over downstream

    tasks for the two aforementioned models, using experiments that take 20$\times$

    less compute. Our experiments are available at

    approach builds on the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, which optimizes

    a set of 3D Gaussians to approximate a radiance field from images. We propose

    first extracting a base mesh from Gaussians during optimization, then building

    and refining an adaptive layer of Gaussians with a variable thickness around

    the mesh to better capture the fine details and volumetric effects near the

    surface, such as hair or grass. We call this layer Gaussian Frosting, as it

    resembles a coating of frosting on a cake. The fuzzier the material, the

    thicker the frosting. We also introduce a parameterization of the Gaussians to

    enforce them to stay inside the frosting layer and automatically adjust their

    parameters when deforming, rescaling, editing or animating the mesh. Our

    representation allows for efficient rendering using Gaussian splatting, as well

    as editing and animation by modifying the base mesh. We demonstrate the

    central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have

    stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success

    stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs).

    However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable

    self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at

    scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling

    when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques

    from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we

    introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization

    techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM

    with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that

    is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule.

    Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM

    blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential

    gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform

    favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space

    a 1B parameter model for 25B tokens (i.e. 1000x larger and 25x longer) which we

    Further, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to human

    mixtures significantly impact performance with single-task performance

    high-quality like Wikipedia have the strongest positive correlation with

    downstream performance; (3) Domains interact in complex ways often

    (4) Data mixture effects transcend scaling laws, and our approach captures the

  abstract: 'We present CogVideoX, a large-scale text-to-video generation model based
    on

    diffusion transformer, which can generate 10-second continuous videos aligned

    with text prompt, with a frame rate of 16 fps and resolution of 768 * 1360

    pixels. Previous video generation models often had limited movement and short

    durations, and is difficult to generate videos with coherent narratives based

    on text. We propose several designs to address these issues. First, we propose

    a 3D Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress videos along both spatial and

    temporal dimensions, to improve both compression rate and video fidelity.

    Second, to improve the text-video alignment, we propose an expert transformer

    with the expert adaptive LayerNorm to facilitate the deep fusion between the

    two modalities. Third, by employing a progressive training and multi-resolution

    frame pack technique, CogVideoX is adept at producing coherent, long-duration,

    different shape videos characterized by significant motions. In addition, we

    develop an effective text-video data processing pipeline that includes various

    data preprocessing strategies and a video captioning method, greatly

    contributing to the generation quality and semantic alignment. Results show

    that CogVideoX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both multiple

    machine metrics and human evaluations. The model weight of both 3D Causal VAE,

    Video caption model and CogVideoX are publicly available at

  abstract: 'Attention is a key part of the transformer architecture. It is a

    sequence-to-sequence mapping that transforms each sequence element into a

    weighted sum of values. The weights are typically obtained as the softmax of

    dot products between keys and queries. Recent work has explored alternatives to

    softmax attention in transformers, such as ReLU and sigmoid activations. In

    this work, we revisit sigmoid attention and conduct an in-depth theoretical and

    empirical analysis. Theoretically, we prove that transformers with sigmoid

    attention are universal function approximators and benefit from improved

    regularity compared to softmax attention. Through detailed empirical analysis,

    we identify stabilization of large initial attention norms during the early

    stages of training as a crucial factor for the successful training of models

    with sigmoid attention, outperforming prior attempts. We also introduce

    FLASHSIGMOID, a hardware-aware and memory-efficient implementation of sigmoid

    attention yielding a 17% inference kernel speed-up over FLASHATTENTION2 on H100

    GPUs. Experiments across language, vision, and speech show that properly

    normalized sigmoid attention matches the strong performance of softmax

    attention on a wide range of domains and scales, which previous attempts at

    sigmoid attention were unable to fully achieve. Our work unifies prior art and

    establishes best practices for sigmoid attention as a drop-in softmax

    replacement in transformers.'

  abstract: 'Quality pretraining data is often seen as the key to high-performance

    language models. However, progress in understanding pretraining data has been

    slow due to the costly pretraining runs required for data selection

    experiments. We present a framework that avoids these costs and selects

    high-quality pretraining data without any LLM training of our own. Our work is

    based on a simple observation: LLM losses on many pretraining texts are

    correlated with downstream benchmark performance, and selecting

    high-correlation documents is an effective pretraining data selection method.

    We build a new statistical framework for data selection centered around

    estimates of perplexity-benchmark correlations and perform data selection using

    a sample of 90 LLMs taken from the Open LLM Leaderboard on texts from tens of

    thousands of web domains. In controlled pretraining experiments at the 160M

    parameter scale on 8 benchmarks, our approach outperforms DSIR on every

    benchmark, while matching the best data selector found in DataComp-LM, a

    hand-engineered bigram classifier.'

  abstract: 'The recently developed retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology
    has

    enabled the efficient construction of domain-specific applications. However, it

    also has limitations, including the gap between vector similarity and the

    relevance of knowledge reasoning, as well as insensitivity to knowledge logic,

    such as numerical values, temporal relations, expert rules, and others, which

    hinder the effectiveness of professional knowledge services. In this work, we

    introduce a professional domain knowledge service framework called Knowledge

    Augmented Generation (KAG). KAG is designed to address the aforementioned

    challenges with the motivation of making full use of the advantages of

    knowledge graph(KG) and vector retrieval, and to improve generation and

    reasoning performance by bidirectionally enhancing large language models (LLMs)

    and KGs through five key aspects: (1) LLM-friendly knowledge representation,

    (2) mutual-indexing between knowledge graphs and original chunks, (3)

    logical-form-guided hybrid reasoning engine, (4) knowledge alignment with

    semantic reasoning, and (5) model capability enhancement for KAG. We compared

    KAG with existing RAG methods in multihop question answering and found that it

    significantly outperforms state-of-theart methods, achieving a relative

    improvement of 19.6% on 2wiki and 33.5% on hotpotQA in terms of F1 score. We

    have successfully applied KAG to two professional knowledge Q&A tasks of Ant

    Group, including E-Government Q&A and E-Health Q&A, achieving significant

    improvement in professionalism compared to RAG methods.'

  abstract: 'Data selection is of great significance in pre-training large language

    models, given the variation in quality within the large-scale available

    training corpora. To achieve this, researchers are currently investigating the

    use of data influence to measure the importance of data instances, $i.e.,$ a

    high influence score indicates that incorporating this instance to the training

    set is likely to enhance the model performance. Consequently, they select the

    top-$k$ instances with the highest scores. However, this approach has several

    limitations. (1) Computing the influence of all available data is

    time-consuming. (2) The selected data instances are not diverse enough, which

    may hinder the pre-trained model''s ability to generalize effectively to various

    downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{Quad}, a data selection

    approach that considers both quality and diversity by using data influence to

    achieve state-of-the-art pre-training results. In particular, noting that

    attention layers capture extensive semantic details, we have adapted the

    accelerated $iHVP$ computation methods for attention layers, enhancing our

    ability to evaluate the influence of data, $i.e.,$ its quality. For the

    diversity, \texttt{Quad} clusters the dataset into similar data instances

    within each cluster and diverse instances across different clusters. For each

    cluster, if we opt to select data from it, we take some samples to evaluate the

    influence to prevent processing all instances. To determine which clusters to

    select, we utilize the classic Multi-Armed Bandit method, treating each cluster

    as an arm. This approach favors clusters with highly influential instances

    (ensuring high quality) or clusters that have been selected less frequently

    (ensuring diversity), thereby well balancing between quality and diversity.'

    requirement definition to the preparation of the final datasets for model

    training. We distinguish between curated data and web data, as each of these

    categories is handled by distinct pipelines, with curated data undergoing

    minimal filtering and web data requiring extensive filtering and deduplication.

    This distinction guided the development of specialized algorithmic solutions

    for both pipelines. In addition to describing the processing methodologies, we

    provide an in-depth analysis of the datasets, increasing transparency and

    smaller value states, and having much larger residual-state norms than those of\n\
    other tokens. These extreme tokens give rise to various challenges in LLM\ninference,\

    \ -- transformers with\none to three layers -- trained on a toy model, the Bigram-Backcopy\
    \ (BB) task.\nIn this setting, we identify an active-dormant mechanism, where\
    \ attention heads\nbecome sinks for specific input domains while remaining non-sinks\
    \ for others.\nOur theoretical analysis of the training dynamics reveals that\
    \ these phenomena\nare driven by a mutual reinforcement mechanism. Building on\
    \ these insights, we\npropose strategies to mitigate extreme-token phenomena during\
    \ pretraining,\nincluding replacing softmax with ReLU and Adam with SGD. Next,\
    \ we extend our\nanalysis to pretrained LLMs, including Llama and OLMo, showing\
    \ that many\nattention heads exhibit a similar active-dormant mechanism as in\
    \ the BB task,\nand that the mutual reinforcement mechanism also governs the emergence\
    \ of\nextreme-token phenomena during LLM pretraining. Our results reveal that\
    \ many of\nthe static and dynamic properties of extreme-token phenomena predicted\
    \ by the\nBB task align with observations in pretrained LLMs."

  abstract: 'An old idea in optimization theory says that since the gradient is a
    dual

    vector it may not be subtracted from the weights without first being mapped to

    the primal space where the weights reside. We take this idea seriously in this

    paper and construct such a duality map for general neural networks. Our map,

    which we call modular dualization, forms a unifying theoretical basis for

    training algorithms that are a) fast and b) scalable. Modular dualization

    involves first assigning operator norms to layers based on the semantics of

    each layer, and then using these layerwise norms to recursively induce a

    duality map on the weight space of the full neural architecture. We conclude by

    deriving GPU-friendly algorithms for dualizing Embed, Linear and Conv2D layers

    -- the latter two methods are based on a rectangular Newton-Schulz iteration

    (Kovarik, 1970; Bj\"orck & Bowie, 1971). A variant of our methods was used to

    set speed records for training NanoGPT. Overall, we hope that our theory of

    modular duality will yield a next generation of fast and scalable optimizers

    for general neural architectures.'

  abstract: 'Low precision training and inference affect both the quality and cost
    of

    language models, but current scaling laws do not account for this. In this

    work, we devise "precision-aware" scaling laws for both training and inference.

    We propose that training in lower precision reduces the model''s "effective

    parameter count," allowing us to predict the additional loss incurred from

    training in low precision and post-train quantization. For inference, we find

    that the degradation introduced by post-training quantization increases as

    models are trained on more data, eventually making additional pretraining data

    actively harmful. For training, our scaling laws allow us to predict the loss

    of a model with different parts in different precisions, and suggest that

    training larger models in lower precision may be compute optimal. We unify the

    scaling laws for post and pretraining quantization to arrive at a single

    functional form that predicts degradation from training and inference in varied

    precisions. We fit on over 465 pretraining runs and validate our predictions on

    model sizes up to 1.7B parameters trained on up to 26B tokens.'

  abstract: 'Large language models are increasingly becoming a cornerstone technology
    in

    artificial intelligence, the sciences, and society as a whole, yet the optimal

    strategies for dataset composition and filtering remain largely elusive. Many

    of the top-performing models lack transparency in their dataset curation and

    model development processes, posing an obstacle to the development of fully

    open language models. In this paper, we identify three core data-related

    challenges that must be addressed to advance open-source language models. These

    include (1) transparency in model development, including the data curation

    process, (2) access to large quantities of high-quality data, and (3)

    availability of artifacts and metadata for dataset curation and analysis. To

    address these challenges, we release RedPajama-V1, an open reproduction of the

    LLaMA training dataset. In addition, we release RedPajama-V2, a massive

    web-only dataset consisting of raw, unfiltered text data together with quality

    signals and metadata. Together, the RedPajama datasets comprise over 100

    trillion tokens spanning multiple domains and with their quality signals

    facilitate the filtering of data, aiming to inspire the development of numerous

    new datasets. To date, these datasets have already been used in the training of

    strong language models used in production, such as Snowflake Arctic,

    Salesforce''s XGen and AI2''s OLMo. To provide insight into the quality of

    RedPajama, we present a series of analyses and ablation studies with

    decoder-only language models with up to 1.6B parameters. Our findings

    demonstrate how quality signals for web data can be effectively leveraged to

    curate high-quality subsets of the dataset, underscoring the potential of

    RedPajama to advance the development of transparent and high-performing

    significant benchmark gains via aggressive model-based filtering, but at the

    to achieve better trade-offs between accuracy and data quantity by a

    combination of classifier ensembling, synthetic data rephrasing, and reduced

    reliance on heuristic filters. When training 8B parameter models for 1T tokens,

    using a high-quality subset of our data improves MMLU by 5.6 over DCLM,

    introduce HunyuanVideo, an innovative open-source video foundation model that

    demonstrates performance in video generation comparable to, or even surpassing,

    that of leading closed-source models. HunyuanVideo encompasses a comprehensive

    framework that integrates several key elements, including data curation,

    advanced architectural design, progressive model scaling and training, and an

    efficient infrastructure tailored for large-scale model training and inference.

    As a result, we successfully trained a video generative model with over 13

    billion parameters, making it the largest among all open-source models. We

    conducted extensive experiments and implemented a series of targeted designs to

    ensure high visual quality, motion dynamics, text-video alignment, and advanced

    filming techniques. According to evaluations by professionals, HunyuanVideo

    outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including Runway Gen-3, Luma 1.6,

    and three top-performing Chinese video generative models. By releasing the code

    for the foundation model and its applications, we aim to bridge the gap between

  abstract: 'Large language models (LLMs) are restricted to reason in the "language

    space", where they typically express the reasoning process with a

    chain-of-thought (CoT) to solve a complex reasoning problem. However, we argue

    that language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, most

    word tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for

    reasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge

    challenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an

    unrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new

    paradigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). We utilize the last hidden

    state of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed "continuous

    thought"). Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the

    LLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space.

    Experiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several

    reasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent

    advanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple

    alternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first

    search (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a

    single deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical

    reasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with

    fewer thinking tokens during inference. These findings demonstrate the promise

    of latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research.'

    transformation, marked by a rapid rise in both their popularity and

    capabilities. Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and

    GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to

    their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs,

    such as LLaMA and Mistral, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing

    popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across

    diverse applications. Although open-source LLMs present unprecedented

    opportunities for innovation and research, the commercialization of LLMs has

    raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many

    open-source LLMs fail to meet fundamental transparency requirements by

    withholding essential components like training code and data, and some use

    restrictive licenses whilst claiming to be "open-source," which may hinder

    further innovations on LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Moxin 7B, a

    fully open-source LLM developed in accordance with the Model Openness Framework

    (MOF), a ranked classification system that evaluates AI models based on model

    completeness and openness, adhering to principles of open science, open source,

    open data, and open access. Our model achieves the highest MOF classification

    level of "open science" through the comprehensive release of pre-training code

    and configurations, training and fine-tuning datasets, and intermediate and

    final checkpoints. Experiments show that our model achieves superior

    performance in zero-shot evaluation compared with popular 7B models and

  abstract: 'Learning a robust video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is essential for

    reducing video redundancy and facilitating efficient video generation. Directly

    applying image VAEs to individual frames in isolation can result in temporal

    inconsistencies and suboptimal compression rates due to a lack of temporal

    compression. Existing Video VAEs have begun to address temporal compression;

    however, they often suffer from inadequate reconstruction performance. In this

    paper, we present a novel and powerful video autoencoder capable of

    high-fidelity video encoding. First, we observe that entangling spatial and

    temporal compression by merely extending the image VAE to a 3D VAE can

    introduce motion blur and detail distortion artifacts. Thus, we propose

    temporal-aware spatial compression to better encode and decode the spatial

    information. Additionally, we integrate a lightweight motion compression model

    for further temporal compression. Second, we propose to leverage the textual

    information inherent in text-to-video datasets and incorporate text guidance

    into our model. This significantly enhances reconstruction quality,

    particularly in terms of detail preservation and temporal stability. Third, we

    further improve the versatility of our model through joint training on both

  abstract: 'Progress in AI is driven largely by the scale and quality of training
    data.

    Despite this, there is a deficit of empirical analysis examining the attributes

    of well-established datasets beyond text. In this work we conduct the largest

    and first-of-its-kind longitudinal audit across modalities--popular text,

    speech, and video datasets--from their detailed sourcing trends and use

    restrictions to their geographical and linguistic representation. Our manual

    analysis covers nearly 4000 public datasets between 1990-2024, spanning 608

    languages, 798 sources, 659 organizations, and 67 countries. We find that

    multimodal machine learning applications have overwhelmingly turned to

    web-crawled, synthetic, and social media platforms, such as YouTube, for their

    training sets, eclipsing all other sources since 2019. Secondly, tracing the

    chain of dataset derivations we find that while less than 33% of datasets are

    restrictively licensed, over 80% of the source content in widely-used text,

    speech, and video datasets, carry non-commercial restrictions. Finally, counter

    to the rising number of languages and geographies represented in public AI

    training datasets, our audit demonstrates measures of relative geographical and

    multilingual representation have failed to significantly improve their coverage

    since 2013. We believe the breadth of our audit enables us to empirically

    examine trends in data sourcing, restrictions, and Western-centricity at an

    ecosystem-level, and that visibility into these questions are essential to

    progress in responsible AI. As a contribution to ongoing improvements in

    dataset transparency and responsible use, we release our entire multimodal

    audit, allowing practitioners to trace data provenance across text, speech, and

    video.'

  abstract: 'Language model alignment has become a critical step in training modern

    generative language models. The goal of alignment is to finetune a reference

    model such that the win rate of a sample from the aligned model over a sample

    from the reference model is high, subject to a KL divergence constraint. Today,

    we are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N,

    controlled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than

    standard sampling. However, the alignment objective does not capture such

    inference-time decoding procedures. We show that the existing alignment

    framework is sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. We then modify

    the alignment objective and propose a framework for inference-aware alignment

    (IAPO). We prove that for any inference-time decoding algorithm, the optimal

    solution that optimizes the inference-time win rate of the aligned policy

    against the reference policy is the solution to the typical RLHF problem with
    a

    transformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the KL-regularized

    calibrate-and-transform RL (CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which

    involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization

    step with a transformation of the calibrated reward. We particularize our study

    to two important inference-time strategies: best-of-N sampling and best-of-N

    jailbreaking, where N responses are sampled from the model and the one with the

    highest or lowest reward is selected. We propose specific transformations for

    these strategies and demonstrate that our framework offers significant

    improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods for language model

    alignment. Empirically, we outperform baselines that are designed without

    taking inference-time decoding into consideration by 8-12% and 4-9% on

    inference-time win rates over the Anthropic helpfulness and harmlessness dialog

    benchmark datasets.'

  abstract: 'We obtain the first analytic, interpretable and predictive theory of

    creativity in convolutional diffusion models. Indeed, score-based diffusion

    models can generate highly creative images that lie far from their training

    data. But optimal score-matching theory suggests that these models should only

    be able to produce memorized training examples. To reconcile this

    theory-experiment gap, we identify two simple inductive biases, locality and

    equivariance, that: (1) induce a form of combinatorial creativity by preventing

    optimal score-matching; (2) result in a fully analytic, completely

    mechanistically interpretable, equivariant local score (ELS) machine that, (3)

    without any training can quantitatively predict the outputs of trained

    convolution only diffusion models (like ResNets and UNets) with high accuracy

    (median $r^2$ of $0.90, 0.91, 0.94$ on CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, and MNIST). Our

    ELS machine reveals a locally consistent patch mosaic model of creativity, in

    which diffusion models create exponentially many novel images by mixing and

    matching different local training set patches in different image locations. Our

    theory also partially predicts the outputs of pre-trained self-attention

    enabled UNets (median $r^2 \sim 0.75$ on CIFAR10), revealing an intriguing role

    for attention in carving out semantic coherence from local patch mosaics.'
