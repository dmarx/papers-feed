  abstract: 'A very simple way to improve the performance of almost any machine learning

    algorithm is to train many different models on the same data and then to

    average their predictions. Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole

    ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to

    allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual

    models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it

    is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which

    is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different

    compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show

    that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used

    commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a

    single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more

    full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained

    classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these

    specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.'

    a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly

    rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative

  abstract: 'Optimal transport (OT) theory can be informally described using the words
    of

    the French mathematician Gaspard Monge (1746-1818): A worker with a shovel in

    hand has to move a large pile of sand lying on a construction site. The goal of

    the worker is to erect with all that sand a target pile with a prescribed shape

    (for example, that of a giant sand castle). Naturally, the worker wishes to

    minimize her total effort, quantified for instance as the total distance or

    time spent carrying shovelfuls of sand. Mathematicians interested in OT cast

    that problem as that of comparing two probability distributions, two different

    piles of sand of the same volume. They consider all of the many possible ways

    to morph, transport or reshape the first pile into the second, and associate a

    "global" cost to every such transport, using the "local" consideration of how

    much it costs to move a grain of sand from one place to another. Recent years

    have witnessed the spread of OT in several fields, thanks to the emergence of

    approximate solvers that can scale to sizes and dimensions that are relevant to

    data sciences. Thanks to this newfound scalability, OT is being increasingly

    used to unlock various problems in imaging sciences (such as color or texture

    processing), computer vision and graphics (for shape manipulation) or machine

    learning (for regression, classification and density fitting). This short book

    reviews OT with a bias toward numerical methods and their applications in data

    sciences, and sheds lights on the theoretical properties of OT that make it

    particularly useful for some of these applications.'

  abstract: 'At present, the mechanisms of in-context learning in Transformers are
    not

    well understood and remain mostly an intuition. In this paper, we suggest that

    training Transformers on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to

    gradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a simple

    weight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations induced

    by 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on
    a

    regression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when

    training self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks either the

    models learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or, remarkably, the

    weights found by optimization match the construction. Thus we show how trained

    Transformers become mesa-optimizers i.e. learn models by gradient descent in

    their forward pass. This allows us, at least in the domain of regression

    problems, to mechanistically understand the inner workings of in-context

    learning in optimized Transformers. Building on this insight, we furthermore

    identify how Transformers surpass the performance of plain gradient descent by

    learning an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models on deep data

    representations to solve non-linear regression tasks. Finally, we discuss

    intriguing parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for in-context

    learning termed induction-head (Olsson et al., 2022) and show how it could be

    understood as a specific case of in-context learning by gradient descent

  abstract: 'Inversion by Direct Iteration (InDI) is a new formulation for supervised

    image restoration that avoids the so-called "regression to the mean" effect and

    produces more realistic and detailed images than existing regression-based

    methods. It does this by gradually improving image quality in small steps,

    similar to generative denoising diffusion models. Image restoration is an

    ill-posed problem where multiple high-quality images are plausible

    reconstructions of a given low-quality input. Therefore, the outcome of a

    single step regression model is typically an aggregate of all possible

    explanations, therefore lacking details and realism. The main advantage of InDI

    is that it does not try to predict the clean target image in a single step but

    instead gradually improves the image in small steps, resulting in better

    perceptual quality. While generative denoising diffusion models also work in

    small steps, our formulation is distinct in that it does not require knowledge

    of any analytic form of the degradation process. Instead, we directly learn an

    iterative restoration process from low-quality and high-quality paired

    examples. InDI can be applied to virtually any image degradation, given paired

    training data. In conditional denoising diffusion image restoration the

    denoising network generates the restored image by repeatedly denoising an

    initial image of pure noise, conditioned on the degraded input. Contrary to

    conditional denoising formulations, InDI directly proceeds by iteratively

    restoring the input low-quality image, producing high-quality results on a

    variety of image restoration tasks, including motion and out-of-focus

    deblurring, super-resolution, compression artifact removal, and denoising.'

  abstract: 'Recent work claims that large language models display emergent abilities,

    abilities not present in smaller-scale models that are present in larger-scale

    models. What makes emergent abilities intriguing is two-fold: their sharpness,

    transitioning seemingly instantaneously from not present to present, and their

    unpredictability, appearing at seemingly unforeseeable model scales. Here, we

    present an alternative explanation for emergent abilities: that for a

    particular task and model family, when analyzing fixed model outputs, emergent

    abilities appear due to the researcher''s choice of metric rather than due to

    fundamental changes in model behavior with scale. Specifically, nonlinear or

    discontinuous metrics produce apparent emergent abilities, whereas linear or

    continuous metrics produce smooth, continuous predictable changes in model

    performance. We present our alternative explanation in a simple mathematical

    model, then test it in three complementary ways: we (1) make, test and confirm

    three predictions on the effect of metric choice using the InstructGPT/GPT-3

    family on tasks with claimed emergent abilities; (2) make, test and confirm two

    predictions about metric choices in a meta-analysis of emergent abilities on

    BIG-Bench; and (3) show to choose metrics to produce never-before-seen

    seemingly emergent abilities in multiple vision tasks across diverse deep

    networks. Via all three analyses, we provide evidence that alleged emergent

    abilities evaporate with different metrics or with better statistics, and may

    not be a fundamental property of scaling AI models.'

  abstract: 'Generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a leading approach
    for

    generating high-dimensional data. In this paper, we show that the dynamics of

    these models exhibit a spontaneous symmetry breaking that divides the

    generative dynamics into two distinct phases: 1) A linear steady-state dynamics

    around a central fixed-point and 2) an attractor dynamics directed towards the

    data manifold. These two "phases" are separated by the change in stability of

    the central fixed-point, with the resulting window of instability being

    responsible for the diversity of the generated samples. Using both theoretical

    and empirical evidence, we show that an accurate simulation of the early

    dynamics does not significantly contribute to the final generation, since early

    fluctuations are reverted to the central fixed point. To leverage this insight,

    we propose a Gaussian late initialization scheme, which significantly improves

    model performance, achieving up to 3x FID improvements on fast samplers, while

    also increasing sample diversity (e.g., racial composition of generated CelebA

    images). Our work offers a new way to understand the generative dynamics of

    diffusion models that has the potential to bring about higher performance and

    less biased fast-samplers.'

    times by orders of magnitude. While these methods demonstrate state-of-the-art

    quality and speed, they are designed for photogrammetry of static scenes and do

    not generalize well to freely moving humans in the environment. In this work,

    we introduce Human Gaussian Splats (HUGS) that represents an animatable human

    together with the scene using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method takes

    only a monocular video with a small number of (50-100) frames, and it

    cloth, hairs), we allow the 3D Gaussians to deviate from the human body model.

    Utilizing 3D Gaussians for animated humans brings new challenges, including the

    optimize the linear blend skinning weights to coordinate the movements of

    the generally degraded style fidelity. To address these challenges, we

    introduce StyleCrafter, a generic method that enhances pre-trained T2V models

    with a style control adapter, enabling video generation in any style by

    providing a reference image. Considering the scarcity of stylized video

    datasets, we propose to first train a style control adapter using style-rich

    image datasets, then transfer the learned stylization ability to video

    generation through a tailor-made finetuning paradigm. To promote content-style

    disentanglement, we remove style descriptions from the text prompt and extract

    style information solely from the reference image using a decoupling learning

    strategy. Additionally, we design a scale-adaptive fusion module to balance the

    influences of text-based content features and image-based style features, which

    helps generalization across various text and style combinations. StyleCrafter

    efficiently generates high-quality stylized videos that align with the content

  abstract: 'Tokenization, the division of input text into input tokens, is an often

    overlooked aspect of the large language model (LLM) pipeline and could be the

    source of useful or harmful inductive biases. Historically, LLMs have relied on

    byte pair encoding, without care to specific input domains. With the increased

    use of LLMs for reasoning, various number-specific tokenization schemes have

    been adopted, with popular models like LLaMa and PaLM opting for single-digit

    tokenization while GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have separate tokens for each 1-, 2-, and

    3-digit numbers. In this work, we study the effect this choice has on numerical

    reasoning through the use of arithmetic tasks. We consider left-to-right and

    right-to-left tokenization for GPT-3.5 and -4, finding that right-to-left

    tokenization (enforced by comma separating numbers at inference time) leads to

    largely improved performance. Furthermore, we find that model errors when using

    standard left-to-right tokenization follow stereotyped error patterns,

    suggesting that model computations are systematic rather than approximate. We

    show that the model is able to convert between tokenizations easily, thus

    allowing chain-of-thought-inspired approaches to recover performance on

    left-to-right tokenized inputs. We also find the gap between tokenization

    directions decreases when models are scaled, possibly indicating that larger

    models are better able to override this tokenization-dependent inductive bias.

    In summary, our work performs the first study of how number tokenization

    choices lead to differences in model performance on arithmetic tasks,

    accompanied by a thorough analysis of error patterns. We hope this work

    inspires practitioners to more carefully ablate number tokenization-related

    choices when working towards general models of numerical reasoning.'

    exploiting randomness in optimization results of consecutive (nearly-identical)

    frames. We develop a new, tool-agnostic framework that segments videos into

    referred to as jailbreaking. However, most of the previous works only focused

    on the text-based jailbreaking in LLMs, and the jailbreaking of the

    several protection tools against style mimicry have been developed that

    incorporate small adversarial perturbations into artworks published online. In

    this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of popular protections -- with

    millions of downloads -- and show they only provide a false sense of security.

    We find that low-effort and "off-the-shelf" techniques, such as image

    upscaling, are sufficient to create robust mimicry methods that significantly

    degrade existing protections. Through a user study, we demonstrate that all

    existing protections can be easily bypassed, leaving artists vulnerable to

    style mimicry. We caution that tools based on adversarial perturbations cannot

    reliably protect artists from the misuse of generative AI, and urge the

    development of alternative non-technological solutions.'

  abstract: 'The Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) aims to make the optimal

    hyperparameters (HPs) of a model independent of its size, allowing them to be

    swept using a cheap proxy model rather than the full-size target model. We

    present a new scheme, u-$\mu$P, which improves upon $\mu$P by combining it with

    Unit Scaling, a method for designing models that makes them easy to train in

    low-precision. The two techniques have a natural affinity: $\mu$P ensures that

    the scale of activations is independent of model size, and Unit Scaling ensures

    that activations, weights and gradients begin training with a scale of one.

    This synthesis opens the door to a simpler scheme, whose default values are

    near-optimal. This in turn facilitates a more efficient sweeping strategy, with

    u-$\mu$P models reaching a loss that is equal to or lower than comparable

    $\mu$P models and working out-of-the-box in FP8.'

  abstract: 'Diffusion Models have emerged as powerful generative models for high-quality

    image synthesis, with many subsequent image editing techniques based on them.

    However, the ease of text-based image editing introduces significant risks,

    such as malicious editing for scams or intellectual property infringement.

    Previous works have attempted to safeguard images from diffusion-based editing

    by adding imperceptible perturbations. These methods are costly and

    specifically target prevalent Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), while

    Pixel-domain Diffusion Models (PDMs) remain largely unexplored and robust

    against such attacks. Our work addresses this gap by proposing a novel

    attacking framework with a feature representation attack loss that exploits

    vulnerabilities in denoising UNets and a latent optimization strategy to

    enhance the naturalness of protected images. Extensive experiments demonstrate

    the effectiveness of our approach in attacking dominant PDM-based editing

    methods (e.g., SDEdit) while maintaining reasonable protection fidelity and

    robustness against common defense methods. Additionally, our framework is

    extensible to LDMs, achieving comparable performance to existing approaches.'

    still

    struggle with complex reasoning tasks requiring multiple steps. While

    prompt-based methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can improve LLM reasoning at

    inference time, optimizing reasoning capabilities during training remains

    challenging. We introduce LaTent Reasoning Optimization (LaTRO), a principled

    framework that formulates reasoning as sampling from a latent distribution and

    optimizes it via variational approaches. LaTRO enables LLMs to concurrently

    improve both their reasoning process and ability to evaluate reasoning quality,

    without requiring external feedback or reward models. We validate LaTRO through

    experiments on GSM8K and ARC-Challenge datasets using multiple model

    architectures. On GSM8K, LaTRO improves zero-shot accuracy by an average of

    12.5% over base models and 9.6% over supervised fine-tuning across

    Phi-3.5-mini, Mistral-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B. Our findings suggest that

    pre-trained LLMs possess latent reasoning capabilities that can be unlocked and

  abstract: 'Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has emerged as a powerful tool for video

    object segmentation and tracking anything. Key components of SAM 2 that drive

    the impressive video object segmentation performance include a large multistage

    image encoder for frame feature extraction and a memory mechanism that stores

    memory contexts from past frames to help current frame segmentation. The high

    computation complexity of multistage image encoder and memory module has

    limited its applications in real-world tasks, e.g., video object segmentation

    on mobile devices. To address this limitation, we propose EfficientTAMs,

    lightweight track anything models that produce high-quality results with low

    latency and model size. Our idea is based on revisiting the plain,

    nonhierarchical Vision Transformer (ViT) as an image encoder for video object

    segmentation, and introducing an efficient memory module, which reduces the

    complexity for both frame feature extraction and memory computation for current

    frame segmentation. We take vanilla lightweight ViTs and efficient memory

    module to build EfficientTAMs, and train the models on SA-1B and SA-V datasets

    for video object segmentation and track anything tasks. We evaluate on multiple

    video segmentation benchmarks including semi-supervised VOS and promptable

    video segmentation, and find that our proposed EfficientTAM with vanilla ViT

    perform comparably to SAM 2 model (HieraB+SAM 2) with ~2x speedup on A100 and

    ~2.4x parameter reduction. On segment anything image tasks, our EfficientTAMs

    also perform favorably over original SAM with ~20x speedup on A100 and ~20x

    parameter reduction. On mobile devices such as iPhone 15 Pro Max, our

    EfficientTAMs can run at ~10 FPS for performing video object segmentation with

    reasonable quality, highlighting the capability of small models for on-device

  abstract: 'Removing modeling constraints and unifying architectures across domains
    has

    been a key driver of the recent progress in training large multimodal models.

    However, most of these models still rely on many separately trained components

    such as modality-specific encoders and decoders. In this work, we further

    streamline joint generative modeling of images and text. We propose an

    autoregressive decoder-only transformer - JetFormer - which is trained to

    directly maximize the likelihood of raw data, without relying on any separately

    pretrained components, and can understand and generate both text and images.

    Specifically, we leverage a normalizing flow model to obtain a soft-token image

    representation that is jointly trained with an autoregressive multimodal

    transformer. The normalizing flow model serves as both an image encoder for

    perception tasks and an image decoder for image generation tasks during

    inference. JetFormer achieves text-to-image generation quality competitive with

    recent VQ-VAE- and VAE-based baselines. These baselines rely on pretrained

    image autoencoders, which are trained with a complex mixture of losses,

    including perceptual ones. At the same time, JetFormer demonstrates robust

    image understanding capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, JetFormer is

    the first model that is capable of generating high-fidelity images and

  abstract: 'Language models (LMs), like other neural networks, often favor shortcut

    heuristics based on surface-level patterns. Although LMs behave like n-gram

    models early in training, they must eventually learn hierarchical syntactic

    representations to correctly apply grammatical rules out-of-distribution (OOD).

    In this work, we use case studies of English grammar to explore how complex,

    diverse training data drives models to generalize OOD. We construct a framework

    that unifies our understanding of random variation with training dynamics, rule

    selection with memorization, and data diversity with complexity. We show that

    these factors are nuanced, and that intermediate levels of diversity and

    complexity lead to inconsistent behavior across random seeds and to unstable

    training dynamics. Our findings emphasize the critical role of training data in

    shaping generalization patterns and illuminate how competing model strategies

    lead to inconsistent generalization outcomes across random seeds. Code is

    its salient functionality. Evaluating MAPS on 20 operations across 6 popular

    LLMs shows its estimations correlate with the head''s outputs during inference

    and are causally linked to the model''s predictions. Moreover, its mappings

    reveal attention heads of certain operations that were overlooked in previous

    studies, and valuable insights on function universality and architecture biases
