  abstract: 'A central problem in machine learning involves modeling complex data-sets

    using highly flexible families of probability distributions in which learning,

    sampling, inference, and evaluation are still analytically or computationally

    tractable. Here, we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both

    flexibility and tractability. The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium

    statistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a

    data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn

    a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly

    flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to

    rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative

    models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute

    conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model. We

    additionally release an open source reference implementation of the algorithm.'

  abstract: 'Cooperative multi-agent systems can be naturally used to model many real

    world problems, such as network packet routing and the coordination of

    autonomous vehicles. There is a great need for new reinforcement learning

    methods that can efficiently learn decentralised policies for such systems. To

    this end, we propose a new multi-agent actor-critic method called

    counterfactual multi-agent (COMA) policy gradients. COMA uses a centralised

    critic to estimate the Q-function and decentralised actors to optimise the

    agents'' policies. In addition, to address the challenges of multi-agent credit

    assignment, it uses a counterfactual baseline that marginalises out a single

    agent''s action, while keeping the other agents'' actions fixed. COMA also uses
    a

    critic representation that allows the counterfactual baseline to be computed

    efficiently in a single forward pass. We evaluate COMA in the testbed of

    StarCraft unit micromanagement, using a decentralised variant with significant

    partial observability. COMA significantly improves average performance over

    other multi-agent actor-critic methods in this setting, and the best performing

    agents are competitive with state-of-the-art centralised controllers that get

    access to the full state.'

    measure (e.g. PSNR, SSIM, IFC, VIF) or by human opinion scores that quantify

    distortion and perceptual quality are at odds with each other. Specifically, we

    study the optimal probability for correctly discriminating the outputs of an

    image restoration algorithm from real images. We show that as the mean

    distortion decreases, this probability must increase (indicating worse

  abstract: 'Optimal transport (OT) theory can be informally described using the words
    of

    the French mathematician Gaspard Monge (1746-1818): A worker with a shovel in

    hand has to move a large pile of sand lying on a construction site. The goal of

    the worker is to erect with all that sand a target pile with a prescribed shape

    (for example, that of a giant sand castle). Naturally, the worker wishes to

    minimize her total effort, quantified for instance as the total distance or

    time spent carrying shovelfuls of sand. Mathematicians interested in OT cast

    that problem as that of comparing two probability distributions, two different

    piles of sand of the same volume. They consider all of the many possible ways

    to morph, transport or reshape the first pile into the second, and associate a

    "global" cost to every such transport, using the "local" consideration of how

    much it costs to move a grain of sand from one place to another. Recent years

    have witnessed the spread of OT in several fields, thanks to the emergence of

    approximate solvers that can scale to sizes and dimensions that are relevant to

    data sciences. Thanks to this newfound scalability, OT is being increasingly

    used to unlock various problems in imaging sciences (such as color or texture

    processing), computer vision and graphics (for shape manipulation) or machine

    learning (for regression, classification and density fitting). This short book

    reviews OT with a bias toward numerical methods and their applications in data

    sciences, and sheds lights on the theoretical properties of OT that make it

    particularly useful for some of these applications.'

  abstract: 'Many recently trained neural networks employ large numbers of parameters
    to

    achieve good performance. One may intuitively use the number of parameters

    required as a rough gauge of the difficulty of a problem. But how accurate are

    such notions? How many parameters are really needed? In this paper we attempt

    to answer this question by training networks not in their native parameter

    space, but instead in a smaller, randomly oriented subspace. We slowly increase

    the dimension of this subspace, note at which dimension solutions first appear,

    and define this to be the intrinsic dimension of the objective landscape. The

    approach is simple to implement, computationally tractable, and produces

    several suggestive conclusions. Many problems have smaller intrinsic dimensions

    than one might suspect, and the intrinsic dimension for a given dataset varies

    little across a family of models with vastly different sizes. This latter

    result has the profound implication that once a parameter space is large enough

    to solve a problem, extra parameters serve directly to increase the

    dimensionality of the solution manifold. Intrinsic dimension allows some

    quantitative comparison of problem difficulty across supervised, reinforcement,

    and other types of learning where we conclude, for example, that solving the

    inverted pendulum problem is 100 times easier than classifying digits from

    MNIST, and playing Atari Pong from pixels is about as hard as classifying

    CIFAR-10. In addition to providing new cartography of the objective landscapes

    wandered by parameterized models, the method is a simple technique for

    constructively obtaining an upper bound on the minimum description length of a

    solution. A byproduct of this construction is a simple approach for compressing

    networks, in some cases by more than 100 times.'

    filter moving at predetermined integer steps (strides). Spatial sizes of

    consecutive layers are related by integer scale factors, predetermined at

    architectural design, and remain fixed throughout training and inference time.

    We propose a generalization of the common Conv-layer, from a discrete layer to

    representing the filter as a learned continuous function over sub-pixel

    coordinates. This allows learnable and principled resizing of feature maps, to

    any size, dynamically and consistently across scales. Once trained, the CC

    layer can be used to output any scale/size chosen at inference time. The scale

    can be non-integer and differ between the axes. CC gives rise to new freedoms

    for architectural design, such as dynamic layer shapes at inference time, or

    gradual architectures where the size changes by a small factor at each layer.

    This gives rise to many desired CNN properties, new architectural design

    each of various tasks within a large & diverse set of upstream & downstream

  abstract: 'Transfer learning has recently become the dominant paradigm of machine

    learning. Pre-trained models fine-tuned for downstream tasks achieve better

    performance with fewer labelled examples. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how

    to develop models that specialise towards multiple tasks without incurring

    negative interference and that generalise systematically to non-identically

    distributed tasks. Modular deep learning has emerged as a promising solution to

    these challenges. In this framework, units of computation are often implemented

    as autonomous parameter-efficient modules. Information is conditionally routed

    to a subset of modules and subsequently aggregated. These properties enable

    positive transfer and systematic generalisation by separating computation from

    routing and updating modules locally. We offer a survey of modular

    architectures, providing a unified view over several threads of research that

    evolved independently in the scientific literature. Moreover, we explore

    various additional purposes of modularity, including scaling language models,

    causal inference, programme induction, and planning in reinforcement learning.

    Finally, we report various concrete applications where modularity has been

    successfully deployed such as cross-lingual and cross-modal knowledge transfer.

  abstract: 'Inversion by Direct Iteration (InDI) is a new formulation for supervised

    image restoration that avoids the so-called "regression to the mean" effect and

    produces more realistic and detailed images than existing regression-based

    methods. It does this by gradually improving image quality in small steps,

    similar to generative denoising diffusion models. Image restoration is an

    ill-posed problem where multiple high-quality images are plausible

    reconstructions of a given low-quality input. Therefore, the outcome of a

    single step regression model is typically an aggregate of all possible

    explanations, therefore lacking details and realism. The main advantage of InDI

    is that it does not try to predict the clean target image in a single step but

    instead gradually improves the image in small steps, resulting in better

    perceptual quality. While generative denoising diffusion models also work in

    small steps, our formulation is distinct in that it does not require knowledge

    of any analytic form of the degradation process. Instead, we directly learn an

    iterative restoration process from low-quality and high-quality paired

    examples. InDI can be applied to virtually any image degradation, given paired

    training data. In conditional denoising diffusion image restoration the

    denoising network generates the restored image by repeatedly denoising an

    initial image of pure noise, conditioned on the degraded input. Contrary to

    conditional denoising formulations, InDI directly proceeds by iteratively

    restoring the input low-quality image, producing high-quality results on a

    variety of image restoration tasks, including motion and out-of-focus

    deblurring, super-resolution, compression artifact removal, and denoising.'

  abstract: 'Generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a leading approach
    for

    generating high-dimensional data. In this paper, we show that the dynamics of

    these models exhibit a spontaneous symmetry breaking that divides the

    generative dynamics into two distinct phases: 1) A linear steady-state dynamics

    around a central fixed-point and 2) an attractor dynamics directed towards the

    data manifold. These two "phases" are separated by the change in stability of

    the central fixed-point, with the resulting window of instability being

    responsible for the diversity of the generated samples. Using both theoretical

    and empirical evidence, we show that an accurate simulation of the early

    dynamics does not significantly contribute to the final generation, since early

    fluctuations are reverted to the central fixed point. To leverage this insight,

    we propose a Gaussian late initialization scheme, which significantly improves

    model performance, achieving up to 3x FID improvements on fast samplers, while

    also increasing sample diversity (e.g., racial composition of generated CelebA

    images). Our work offers a new way to understand the generative dynamics of

    diffusion models that has the potential to bring about higher performance and

    times by orders of magnitude. While these methods demonstrate state-of-the-art

    quality and speed, they are designed for photogrammetry of static scenes and do

    not generalize well to freely moving humans in the environment. In this work,

    we introduce Human Gaussian Splats (HUGS) that represents an animatable human

    together with the scene using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method takes

    only a monocular video with a small number of (50-100) frames, and it

    automatically learns to disentangle the static scene and a fully animatable

    human avatar within 30 minutes. We utilize the SMPL body model to initialize

    the human Gaussians. To capture details that are not modeled by SMPL (e.g.

    cloth, hairs), we allow the 3D Gaussians to deviate from the human body model.

    Utilizing 3D Gaussians for animated humans brings new challenges, including the

    artifacts created when articulating the Gaussians. We propose to jointly

    optimize the linear blend skinning weights to coordinate the movements of

  abstract: 'Tokenization, the division of input text into input tokens, is an often

    overlooked aspect of the large language model (LLM) pipeline and could be the

    source of useful or harmful inductive biases. Historically, LLMs have relied on

    byte pair encoding, without care to specific input domains. With the increased

    use of LLMs for reasoning, various number-specific tokenization schemes have

    been adopted, with popular models like LLaMa and PaLM opting for single-digit

    tokenization while GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have separate tokens for each 1-, 2-, and

    3-digit numbers. In this work, we study the effect this choice has on numerical

    reasoning through the use of arithmetic tasks. We consider left-to-right and

    right-to-left tokenization for GPT-3.5 and -4, finding that right-to-left

    tokenization (enforced by comma separating numbers at inference time) leads to

    largely improved performance. Furthermore, we find that model errors when using

    standard left-to-right tokenization follow stereotyped error patterns,

    suggesting that model computations are systematic rather than approximate. We

    show that the model is able to convert between tokenizations easily, thus

    allowing chain-of-thought-inspired approaches to recover performance on

    left-to-right tokenized inputs. We also find the gap between tokenization

    directions decreases when models are scaled, possibly indicating that larger

    models are better able to override this tokenization-dependent inductive bias.

    In summary, our work performs the first study of how number tokenization

    choices lead to differences in model performance on arithmetic tasks,

    accompanied by a thorough analysis of error patterns. We hope this work

    inspires practitioners to more carefully ablate number tokenization-related

    choices when working towards general models of numerical reasoning.'

  abstract: 'While the impressive performance of modern neural networks is often

    attributed to their capacity to efficiently extract task-relevant features from

    data, the mechanisms underlying this rich feature learning regime remain

    elusive, with much of our theoretical understanding stemming from the opposing

    lazy regime. In this work, we derive exact solutions to a minimal model that

    transitions between lazy and rich learning, precisely elucidating how

    unbalanced layer-specific initialization variances and learning rates determine

    the degree of feature learning. Our analysis reveals that they conspire to

    influence the learning regime through a set of conserved quantities that

    constrain and modify the geometry of learning trajectories in parameter and

    function space. We extend our analysis to more complex linear models with

    multiple neurons, outputs, and layers and to shallow nonlinear networks with

    piecewise linear activation functions. In linear networks, rapid feature

    learning only occurs from balanced initializations, where all layers learn at

    similar speeds. While in nonlinear networks, unbalanced initializations that

    promote faster learning in earlier layers can accelerate rich learning. Through

    a series of experiments, we provide evidence that this unbalanced rich regime

    drives feature learning in deep finite-width networks, promotes

    interpretability of early layers in CNNs, reduces the sample complexity of

    learning hierarchical data, and decreases the time to grokking in modular

    arithmetic. Our theory motivates further exploration of unbalanced

  abstract: 'Dense linear layers are the dominant computational bottleneck in foundation

    models. Identifying more efficient alternatives to dense matrices has enormous

    potential for building more compute-efficient models, as exemplified by the

    success of convolutional networks in the image domain. In this work, we

    systematically explore structured matrices as replacements for dense matrices.

    We show that different structures often require drastically different

    initialization scales and learning rates, which are crucial to performance,

    especially as models scale. Using insights from the Maximal Update

    Parameterization, we determine the optimal scaling for initialization and

    learning rates of these unconventional layers. Finally, we measure the scaling

    laws of different structures to compare how quickly their performance improves

    with compute. We propose a novel matrix family containing Monarch matrices, the

    Block Tensor-Train (BTT), which we show performs better than dense matrices for

    the same compute on multiple tasks. On CIFAR-10/100 with augmentation, BTT

    achieves exponentially lower training loss than dense when training MLPs and

    ViTs. BTT matches dense ViT-S/32 performance on ImageNet-1k with 3.8 times less

    compute and is more efficient than dense for training small GPT-2 language

    models.'

  abstract: 'The model editing problem concerns how language models should learn new
    facts

    about the world over time. While empirical research on model editing has drawn

    widespread attention, the conceptual foundations of model editing remain shaky

    -- perhaps unsurprisingly, since model editing is essentially belief revision,

    a storied problem in philosophy that has eluded succinct solutions for decades.

    Model editing nonetheless demands a solution, since we need to be able to

    control the knowledge within language models. With this goal in mind, this

    paper critiques the standard formulation of the model editing problem and

    proposes a formal testbed for model editing research. We first describe 12 open

    problems with model editing, based on challenges with (1) defining the problem,

    (2) developing benchmarks, and (3) assuming LLMs have editable beliefs in the

    first place. Many of these challenges are extremely difficult to address, e.g.

    determining far-reaching consequences of edits, labeling probabilistic

    entailments between facts, and updating beliefs of agent simulators. Next, we

    introduce a semi-synthetic dataset for model editing based on Wikidata, where

    we can evaluate edits against labels given by an idealized Bayesian agent. This

    enables us to say exactly how belief revision in language models falls short of

    a desirable epistemic standard. We encourage further research exploring

    settings where such a gold standard can be compared against. Our code is

  abstract: 'Robust and effective scaling of models from small to large width typically

    requires the precise adjustment of many algorithmic and architectural details,

    such as parameterization and optimizer choices. In this work, we propose a new

    perspective on parameterization by investigating a key assumption in prior work

    about the alignment between parameters and data and derive new theoretical

    results under weaker assumptions and a broader set of optimizers. Our extensive

    empirical investigation includes tens of thousands of models trained with all

    combinations of three optimizers, four parameterizations, several alignment

    assumptions, more than a dozen learning rates, and fourteen model sizes up to

    26.8B parameters. We find that the best learning rate scaling prescription

    would often have been excluded by the assumptions in prior work. Our results

    show that all parameterizations, not just maximal update parameterization

    (muP), can achieve hyperparameter transfer; moreover, our novel per-layer

    learning rate prescription for standard parameterization outperforms muP.

    Finally, we demonstrate that an overlooked aspect of parameterization, the

    epsilon parameter in Adam, must be scaled correctly to avoid gradient underflow

    and propose Adam-atan2, a new numerically stable, scale-invariant version of

    Adam that eliminates the epsilon hyperparameter entirely.'

  abstract: 'Enabling LLMs to improve their outputs by using more test-time computation
    is

    a critical step towards building generally self-improving agents that can

    operate on open-ended natural language. In this paper, we study the scaling of

    inference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering the question: if

    an LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time

    compute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt?

    Answering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance

    of LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff

    inference-time and pre-training compute. Despite its importance, little

    research attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time

    inference methods. Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for

    a number of these strategies. In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms

    to scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based

    verifier reward models; and (2) updating the model''s distribution over a

    response adaptively, given the prompt at test time. We find that in both cases,

    the effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute

    critically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt. This observation

    motivates applying a "compute-optimal" scaling strategy, which acts to most

    effectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. Using this

    compute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute

    scaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline. Additionally, in a

    FLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a smaller base model

    attains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to

    outperform a 14x larger model.'

    efforts focused on a small number of hand-crafted structured matrices and

    neglected to investigate whether these structures can surpass dense layers in

    terms of compute-optimal scaling laws when both the model size and training

    examples are optimally allocated. In this work, we present a unifying framework

    mostly governed by a small number of variables that we introduce. Namely, a

    small $\omega$ (which measures parameter sharing) and large $\psi$ (which

    measures the rank) reliably led to better scaling laws. Guided by the insight

    that full-rank structures that maximize parameters per unit of compute perform

    the best, we propose BTT-MoE, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture

    However, such strict dense guidance impairs the quality of the generated video

    when the body shape of the reference character differs significantly from that

    of the driving video. In this paper, we present DisPose to mine more

    generalizable and effective control signals without additional dense input,

    which disentangles the sparse skeleton pose in human image animation into

    motion field guidance and keypoint correspondence. Specifically, we generate a

    dense motion field from a sparse motion field and the reference image, which

    provides region-level dense guidance while maintaining the generalization of

    the sparse pose control. We also extract diffusion features corresponding to

    pose keypoints from the reference image, and then these point features are

    transferred to the target pose to provide distinct identity information. To

    seamlessly integrate into existing models, we propose a plug-and-play hybrid

    diverse range of ALife substrates including Boids, Particle Life, Game of Life,

    Lenia, and Neural Cellular Automata. A major result highlighting the potential

    of this technique is the discovery of previously unseen Lenia and Boids

    lifeforms, as well as cellular automata that are open-ended like Conway''s Game

    of Life. Additionally, the use of FMs allows for the quantification of

    previously qualitative phenomena in a human-aligned way. This new paradigm

    promises to accelerate ALife research beyond what is possible through human

    ingenuity alone.'
