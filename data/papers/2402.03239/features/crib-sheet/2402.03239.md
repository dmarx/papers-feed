- **Bluesky Overview**
  - Launched in February 2023, over 10 million users by October 2024.
  - Built on the AT Protocol, enabling decentralized social media.

- **AT Protocol Goals**
  - Enable decentralization with multiple interoperable providers.
  - Facilitate easy provider switching for users.
  - Enhance user agency over content visibility.
  - Simplify user experience despite decentralized architecture.

- **Moderation Mechanisms**
  - **Content Filtering**: Automated labeling of problematic content.
  - **Mute**: Users can mute accounts/threads; mutelists can be shared.
  - **Block**: Prevents interactions between users; blocklists can be shared.
  - **Interaction Gating**: Control who can reply to posts.
  - **Quote Detachment**: Original authors can detach their posts from quotes.
  - **Takedown**: Users can report violations for moderation action.
  - **Custom Feeds**: Users can create and subscribe to feeds based on preferences.

- **User Handles**
  - Unique handles using DNS domain names (e.g., subdomains of .bsky.social).
  - Allows users to maintain handles across different servers.
  - Supports organizational subdomains for staff identification.

- **Custom Feeds and Algorithmic Choice**
  - Offers a marketplace of algorithms for content discovery.
  - Users can create custom feed generators using various criteria.
  - Tens of thousands of custom feeds already created.

- **AT Protocol Architecture**
  - Supports multiple social modes beyond microblogging (e.g., forums, blogs).
  - Lexicons define data schema and request endpoints (e.g., com.atproto, app.bsky).
  - Designed for public content; private communications to be decentralized in future.

- **User Data Repositories**
  - User actions stored in a repository as records (DAG-CBOR format).
  - Media files referenced by CID from records.
  - Each user has a single repository; actions do not alter others' repositories.

- **Research Opportunities**
  - Open access to Bluesky data for research on moderation and disinformation.
  - Encouragement for researchers to develop algorithms using Bluesky's dataset.
