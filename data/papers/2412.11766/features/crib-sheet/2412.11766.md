- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Complex Contagion:** Human behavior dynamics, such as vaccine uptake, depend on multiple social contacts rather than a single infected neighbor.
  - **SIR Model:** Standard model for epidemic spread defined by:
    - \( S + I \xrightarrow{\beta} I + I \) (infection)
    - \( I \xrightarrow{\mu} R \) (recovery)
  - **Vaccination Dynamics:** Modeled as a Poisson process:
    - \( S \xrightarrow{\alpha} V \) (vaccination uptake)

- **Model Structure:**
  - **Multilayer Network:** Age-structured contact network based on US contact data.
  - **Opinion Dynamics:** Binary attitudes towards vaccination (hesitant \( H \) or active \( A \)) influenced by peer behavior.
  - **Threshold-Based Updating:** 
    - \( o_i(t + 1) = 1 \) if the number of vaccinated neighbors exceeds a threshold.

- **Parameters:**
  - **Basic Reproduction Number:** \( R_0 = 1.5 \)
  - **Recovery Rate:** \( \mu = 0.2 \)
  - **Vaccination Rate (\( \alpha \)):** Ranges from \( 0.001 \) to \( 0.05 \).
  - **Activation Threshold (\( \theta \)):** Influences the transition from hesitant to active vaccination behavior.

- **Observables:**
  - **Active Agents:** \( N_A(\infty) \) - number of convinced individuals.
  - **Prevalence:** \( R(\infty) \) - fraction of the population infected.
  - **Vaccination Coverage:** \( V(\infty) \) - number of vaccinated individuals.
  - **Normalized Measures:**
    - \( r(\infty) = R(\infty)/N \)
    - \( v(\infty) = V(\infty)/N \)
    - \( n_A(\infty) = N_A(\infty)/N \)
    - \( \Delta n_A(\infty) = n_A(\infty) - n_A(0)/(1 - n_A(0)) \)

- **Simulation Approach:**
  - **Monte Carlo Simulations:** Used to explore the coupled dynamics on the multilayer network.
  - **Parameter Variation:** Examines the impact of varying \( \alpha \), \( \theta \), and initial conditions \( n_A(0) \).

- **Results Overview:**
  - **Homogeneous Thresholds:** Initial analysis shows low vaccination rates lead to high disease prevalence.
  - **Behavioral Cascades:** Higher initial support for vaccination can trigger significant uptake under moderate vaccination efforts.

- **Implications:**
  - Understanding the interplay between epidemic dynamics and social behavior is crucial for effective vaccination campaigns.
  - Insights from the model can inform public health strategies to enhance vaccine uptake in populations with varying attitudes.
