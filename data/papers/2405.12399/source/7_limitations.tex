\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

We identify three main limitations of our work for future research. First, our main evaluation is focused on discrete control environments, and applying \textsc{diamond} to the continuous domain may provide additional insights. Second, the use of frame stacking for conditioning is a minimal mechanism to provide a memory of past observations. Integrating an autoregressive transformer over environment time, using an approach such as \citet{dit2023}, would enable longer-term memory and better scalability. We include an initial investigation into a potential cross-attention architecture in Appendix \ref{app:additonal_experiments}, but found frame-stacking more effective in our early experiments. Third, we leave potential integration of the reward/termination prediction into the diffusion model for future work, since combining these objectives and extracting representations from a diffusion model is not trivial \citep{luo2023dhf, xu2023open} and would make our world model unnecessarily complex.
