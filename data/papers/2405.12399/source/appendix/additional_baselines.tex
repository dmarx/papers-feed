\section{Broader comparison to model-free and search-based methods}
\label{app:additonal_baselines}

Table \ref{tab:atari_results_other_baselines} provides scores for model-free and search-based methods, including the current best performing methods on the Atari 100k benchmark, EfficientZero \citep{ye2021efficientzero} and \textsc{bbf} \citep{schwarzer2023bigger}. Both of these methods use approaches that are out of scope of our approach, such as computationally expensive lookahead Monte-Carlo tree search for EfficientZero, and using periodic network resets in combination with hyperparameter scheduling for \textsc{bbf}. We see that while the use of lookahead search and more advanced reinforcement learning techniques (for EfficientZero \citep{ye2021efficientzero} and \textsc{bbf} \citep{schwarzer2023bigger} respectively) can still provide greater performance overall, \textsc{diamond} promisingly still outperforms these methods on some games.
