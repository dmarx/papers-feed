\section{Additional performance comparisons}
\label{app:performance_profile}

We provide performance profiles \citep{agarwal2021deep} for \textsc{diamond} and baselines below. % We see that \textsc{diamond} outperforms the baselines in terms of the fraction of runs above a given human normalized score for a range of scores.

As additional angles of comparison, we also provide parameter counts and approximate training times for \textsc{iris}, DreamerV3 and \textsc{diamond} in Table \ref{tab:training_time} below. We see that \textsc{diamond} has the highest mean HNS, with fewer parameters than both \textsc{iris} and DreamerV3. \textsc{diamond} also trains faster than \textsc{iris}, although is slower than DreamerV3.

A full training time profile for \textsc{diamond} is provided in Appendix~\ref{app:profiling}.
