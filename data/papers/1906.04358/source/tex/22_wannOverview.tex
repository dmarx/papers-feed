        \textit{Overview of Weight Agnostic Neural Network Search}
        \newline
        Weight Agnostic Neural Network Search avoids weight training while exploring the space of neural network topologies by sampling a single shared weight at each rollout. 
        %
        Networks are evaluated over several rollouts. At each rollout a value for the single shared weight is assigned and the cumulative reward over the trial is recorded. 
        %
        The population of networks is then ranked according to their performance and complexity. 
        %
        The highest ranking networks are then chosen probabilistically and varied randomly to form a new population, and the process repeats.
