% * To make clearer in gen 8 change 'step' to 'sig' and test again (it is illustrative anyway)
% * Color code neurons better

        \textit{Generation 8:} An early network which performs poorly with nearly all weights.
        \newline
        \textit{Generation 32:} Relationships between the position of the cart and velocity of the pole are established. The tension between these relationships produces both centering and swing-up behavior.
        \newline
        \textit{Generation 128:} Complexity is added to refine the balancing behavior of the elevated pole.
