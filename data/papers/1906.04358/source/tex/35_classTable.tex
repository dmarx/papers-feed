        \textit{Left:}
        WANNs instantiated with multiple weight values acting as an ensemble perform far better than when weights are sampled at random, and as well as a linear classifier with thousands of weights.

        %The accuracy of the best single weight value exceeds this. 
        \newline
        \textit{Right:} No single weight value has better accuracy on all digits. That WANNs can be instantiated as several \textit{different} networks has intriguing possibilities for the creation of ensembles.
