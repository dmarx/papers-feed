- **Modular Dualization Concept**: A theoretical framework for constructing duality maps for neural networks, enhancing training algorithms' speed and scalability.

- **Operator Norm Assignment**: Assign operator norms to individual layers based on their semantics to facilitate duality map construction.

- **Duality Map Construction**: 
  - **Step 1**: Assign operator norms to layers.
  - **Step 2**: Construct duality maps for individual layers.
  - **Step 3**: Induce a single duality map on the full weight space recursively.

- **Gradient Update Type Check**: 
  - **Failed**: \( \text{weight} \cdot \text{LR} \cdot \text{weight.grad} \)
  - **Passed**: \( \text{weight} \cdot \text{LR} \cdot \text{dualize}(\text{weight.grad}) \)

- **Loss Function Geometry**: The loss function may exhibit non-isotropic curvature, necessitating a duality map to adjust gradient size and direction.

- **Duality Maps in Optimization**: 
  - Common in physics and optimization theories (e.g., mirror descent, natural gradient descent).
  - Essential for understanding the geometry of loss functions in neural networks.

- **Key Contributions**: 
  - Derivation of GPU-friendly algorithms for dualizing Embed, Linear, and Conv2D layers.
  - Use of rectangular Newton-Schulz iteration for efficient computation.

- **Comparison with Prior Work**: 
  - Modular dualization contrasts with spectral descent and duality structure gradient descent by providing a recursive, modular approach to duality maps.

- **Modular Norm Definition**: 
  - A norm designed to characterize the heterogeneous curvature of neural architectures, allowing for the construction of well-normed modules.

- **Induced Operator Norm**: 
  - For a matrix \( M \) and norms \( \| \cdot \|_\alpha \) and \( \| \cdot \|_\beta \):
  \[
  \| M \|_{\alpha \to \beta} = \max_{x \in R^{d_{in}}} \frac{\| Mx \|_\beta}{\| x \|_\alpha}
  \]

- **Example Duality Maps**:
  - **Euclidean Norm**: \( \text{dualize}(\| \cdot \|_2) g = g \)
  - **Infinity Norm**: \( \text{dualize}(\| \cdot \|_\infty) g = \text{sign}(g) \)

- **RMS to RMS Induced Operator Norm**: 
  - For a matrix \( W \):
  \[
  \| W \|_{\text{RMS} \to \text{RMS}} = \frac{a_{d_{in}}}{d_{out}} \cdot \| W \|_*
  \]

- **Embedding Layer Duality Map**: 
  - Normalizes each column of \( G \) to have unit RMS norm.

- **Algorithmic Implications**: The proposed methods aim to set speed records for training models like NanoGPT, indicating practical applications of the theoretical framework.
