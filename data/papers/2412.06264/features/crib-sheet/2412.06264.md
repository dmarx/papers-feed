- **Flow Matching (FM) Overview**: A generative modeling framework achieving state-of-the-art performance in various domains (images, videos, audio, etc.).
  
- **Key Objective**: Transform a source sample \( X_0 \sim p \) into a target sample \( X_1 = \psi_1(X_0) \sim q \) using a flow defined by a velocity field \( u_t \).

- **Mathematical Foundation**: 
  - Flow defined by ODE: 
    \[
    \frac{d}{dt} \psi_t(x) = u_t(\psi_t(x)), \quad \psi_0(x) = x
    \]
  - Goal: Learn \( u_\theta(t) \) such that \( X_t \sim p_t \) for \( X_0 \sim p_0 \).

- **Flow Matching Recipe**:
  1. Choose a probability path \( p_t \) interpolating between source \( p \) and target \( q \).
  2. Train a velocity field \( u_\theta(t) \) using regression.

- **Flow Matching Loss**:
  - General form:
    \[
    L_{FM}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t,X_t} \left[ \| u_\theta(t, X_t) - u_t(X_t) \|^2 \right]
    \]
  - Conditional version:
    \[
    L_{CFM}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t,X_t,X_1} \left[ \| u_\theta(t, X_t) - u_t(X_t | X_1) \|^2 \right]
    \]

- **Probability Path Example**: 
  - For \( p_0 = N(x|0, I) \):
    \[
    p_t(x) = \int p_{t|1}(x|x_1) q(x_1) dx_1
    \]
  - Conditional path:
    \[
    p_{t|1}(x|x_1) = N(x|tx_1, (1-t)^2 I)
    \]

- **Velocity Field Implementation**:
  - Simplified loss:
    \[
    L_{OT,Gauss CFM}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t,X_0,X_1} \left[ \| u_\theta(t, X_t) - (X_1 - X_0) \|^2 \right]
    \]

- **Extensions of Flow Matching**:
  - **Discrete Flow Matching**: Adapts FM for Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMC).
  - **Riemannian Flow Matching**: Extends FM to Riemannian manifolds, applicable in chemistry (e.g., protein folding).
  - **Generator Matching**: Unifies various generative models under a common framework.

- **Diffusion Models**: 
  - First to achieve simulation-free training of CTMP processes.
  - Forward noising processes modeled by SDEs, learning score functions for marginal probabilities.
