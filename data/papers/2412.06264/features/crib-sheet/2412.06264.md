- **Flow Matching (FM) Overview**: A generative modeling framework achieving state-of-the-art performance in various domains (images, videos, audio, etc.).
  
- **Key Objective**: Transform a source sample \( X_0 \sim p \) into a target sample \( X_1 = \psi_1(X_0) \sim q \) using a flow defined by a velocity field \( u_t \).

- **Mathematical Foundation**: The flow \( \psi_t \) is defined by the ODE:
  \[
  \frac{d}{dt} \psi_t(x) = u_t(\psi_t(x)), \quad \psi_0(x) = x
  \]

- **Flow Matching Recipe**:
  1. Choose a probability path \( p_t \) interpolating between source \( p \) and target \( q \).
  2. Train a velocity field \( u_t \) to define the flow transformation.

- **Flow Matching Loss Function**:
  \[
  L_{FM}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t,X_t} \left[ \| u_\theta(X_t) - u_t(X_t) \|^2 \right]
  \]

- **Conditional Flow Matching Loss**:
  \[
  L_{CFM}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t,X_t,X_1} \left[ \| u_\theta(X_t) - u_t(X_t | X_1) \|^2 \right]
  \]

- **Velocity Field**: The velocity field \( u_t \) is modeled as a neural network, which generates the probability path \( p_t \).

- **Probability Path Example**: For a Gaussian source distribution \( p_0 = N(x|0, I) \):
  \[
  p_t(x) = \int p_{t|1}(x|x_1) q(x_1) dx_1
  \]
  where \( p_{t|1}(x|x_1) = N(x|tx_1, (1-t)^2 I) \).

- **Sampling Process**: Generate a sample from the target distribution by:
  1. Drawing \( X_0 \sim p \).
  2. Solving the ODE to obtain \( X_1 = \psi_1(X_0) \).

- **Extensions of Flow Matching**:
  - **Discrete Flow Matching**: Adapts FM for Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMC).
  - **Riemannian Flow Matching**: Extends FM to Riemannian manifolds, applicable in chemistry (e.g., protein folding).
  - **Generator Matching**: Unifies various generative models under the FM framework.

- **Diffusion Models**: A specific instance of FM, utilizing SDEs for training without simulation, focusing on score functions for parameterization.
