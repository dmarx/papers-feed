    abstract = { Active particles contain internal degrees of freedom with the ability to take in and dissipate energy and, in the process, execute systematic movement. Examples include all living organisms and their motile constituents such as molecular motors. This article reviews recent progress in applying the principles of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and hydrodynamics to form a systematic theory of the behavior of collections of active particles–active matter–with only minimal regard to microscopic details. A unified view of the many kinds of active matter is presented, encompassing not only living systems but inanimate analogs. Theory and experiment are discussed side by side. }

	abstract = {Successful sperm navigation is essential for sexual reproduction, yet we still understand relatively little about how sperm cells are able to adapt their swimming motion in response to chemical and physical cues. This lack of knowledge is owed to the fact that it has been difficult to observe directly the full 3D dynamics of the whip-like flagellum that propels the cell through the fluid. To overcome this deficiency, we apply a new algorithm to reconstruct the 3D beat patterns of human sperm cells in experiments under varying flow conditions. Our analysis reveals that the swimming strokes of human sperm are considerably more complex than previously thought, and that sperm may use their heads as rudders to turn right or left.Rheotaxis, the directed response to fluid velocity gradients, has been shown to facilitate stable upstream swimming of mammalian sperm cells along solid surfaces, suggesting a robust physical mechanism for long-distance navigation during fertilization. However, the dynamics by which a human sperm orients itself relative to an ambient flow is poorly understood. Here, we combine microfluidic experiments with mathematical modeling and 3D flagellar beat reconstruction to quantify the response of individual sperm cells in time-varying flow fields. Single-cell tracking reveals two kinematically distinct swimming states that entail opposite turning behaviors under flow reversal. We constrain an effective 2D model for the turning dynamics through systematic large-scale parameter scans, and find good quantitative agreement with experiments at different shear rates and viscosities. Using a 3D reconstruction algorithm to identify the flagellar beat patterns causing left or right turning, we present comprehensive 3D data demonstrating the rolling dynamics of freely swimming sperm cells around their longitudinal axis. Contrary to current beliefs, this 3D analysis uncovers ambidextrous flagellar waveforms and shows that the cell{\textquoteright}s turning direction is not defined by the rolling direction. Instead, the different rheotactic turning behaviors are linked to a broken mirror symmetry in the midpiece section, likely arising from a buckling instability. These results challenge current theoretical models of sperm locomotion.},

title = "Vibrio cholerae use pili and flagella synergistically to effect motility switching and conditional surface attachment",
abstract = "We show that Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, use their flagella and mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin (MSHA) type IV pili synergistically to switch between two complementary motility states that together facilitate surface selection and attachment. Flagellar rotation counter-rotates the cell body, causing MSHA pili to have periodic mechanical contact with the surface for surface-skimming cells. Using tracking algorithms at 5 ms resolution we observe two motility behaviours: {\textquoteleft}roaming', characterized by meandering trajectories, and {\textquoteleft}orbiting{\textquoteright}, characterized by repetitive high-curvature orbits. We develop a hydrodynamic model showing that these phenotypes result from a nonlinear relationship between trajectory shape and frictional forces between pili and the surface: strong pili–surface interactions generate orbiting motion, increasing the local bacterial loiter time. Time-lapse imaging reveals how only orbiting mode cells can attach irreversibly and form microcolonies. These observations suggest that MSHA pili are crucial for surface selection, irreversible attachment, and ultimately microcolony formation.",

abstract  ={In this work{,} we study the stationary behavior of an assembly of independent chiral active particles under confinement by employing an extension of the active Ornstein–Uhlenbeck model. The chirality modeled by means of an effective torque term leads to a drastic reduction in the accumulation near the walls with respect to the case without handedness and to the appearance of currents parallel to the container walls accompanied by a large accumulation of particles in the inner region. In the case of two-dimensional chiral particles confined by harmonic walls{,} we determine the analytic form of the distribution of positions and velocities in two different situations: a rotationally invariant confining potential and an infinite channel with parabolic walls. Both these models display currents and chirality induced inner accumulation. These phenomena are further investigated by means of a more realistic description of a channel{,} where the wall and bulk regions are clearly separated. The corresponding current and density profiles are obtained by numerical simulations. At variance with the harmonic models{,} the third model shows a progressive emptying of the wall regions and the simultaneous enhancement of the bulk population. We explain such a phenomenon in terms of the combined effect of wall repulsive forces and chiral motion and provide a semiquantitative description of the current profile in terms of effective viscosity of the chiral gas.}}

ABSTRACT={In nature as well as in the context of infection and medical applications, bacteria often have to move in highly complex environments such as soil or tissues. Previous studies have shown that bacteria strongly interact with their surroundings and are often guided by confinements. Here, we investigate theoretically how the dispersal of swimming bacteria can be augmented by microfluidic environments and validate our theoretical predictions experimentally. We consider a system of bacteria performing the prototypical run-and-tumble motion inside a labyrinth with square lattice geometry. Narrow channels between the square obstacles limit the possibility of bacteria to reorient during tumbling events to an area where channels cross. Thus, by varying the geometry of the lattice it might be possible to control the dispersal of cells. We present a theoretical model quantifying diffusive spreading of a run-and-tumble random walker in a square lattice. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical predictions for the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the lattice geometry. We show that bacteria moving in square labyrinths exhibit enhanced dispersal as compared to unconfined cells. Importantly, confinement significantly extends the duration of the phase with strongly non-Gaussian diffusion, when the geometry of channels is imprinted in the density profiles of spreading cells. Finally, in good agreement with our theoretical findings, we observe the predicted behaviors in experiments with E. coli bacteria swimming in a square lattice labyrinth created in a microfluidic device. Altogether, our comprehensive understanding of bacterial dispersal in a simple two-dimensional labyrinth makes the first step toward the analysis of more complex geometries relevant for real world applications.}

    abstract = { Motile cilia and flagella protrude from the surface of many eukaryotic cells. Understanding how cilia and flagella operate is important for understanding ciliated cells in metazoans, the ecology and behavior of motile microorganisms, and the mechanisms of molecular motors and signal transduction. Using very-high-speed video microscopy, Polin et al. (p. 487; see the Perspective by Stocker and Durham) discovered that the biflagellated cells of the single-cell alga Chlamydomonas rheinhartii switch between synchronous beating, which keeps the cells traveling forward, and asynchronous beating, which allows the organisms to make sharp turns. This random progression occurs in the dark and allows cells to diffuse, and it may underpin directional movement toward light in the same way that the run-and-tumble behavior of prokaryotes allows them to move up chemical gradients. Algal cilia beat synchronously for forward movement and asynchronously for turning. The coordination of eukaryotic flagella is essential for many of the most basic processes of life (motility, sensing, and development), yet its emergence and regulation and its connection to locomotion are poorly understood. Previous studies show that the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas, widely regarded as an ideal system in which to study flagellar biology, swims forward by the synchronous action of its two flagella. Using high-speed imaging over long intervals, we found a richer behavior: A cell swimming in the dark stochastically switches between synchronous and asynchronous flagellar beating. Three-dimensional tracking shows that these regimes lead, respectively, to nearly straight swimming and to abrupt large reorientations, which yield a eukaryotic version of the "run-and-tumble" motion of peritrichously flagellated bacteria. }

Here{,} we investigate a model for a single ideal circle swimmer exploring a two-dimensional disordered array of impenetrable obstacles. The microswimmer moves on circular orbits in the freely accessible space and follows the surface of an obstacle for a certain time upon collision. Depending on the obstacle density and the radius of the circular orbits{,} the microswimmer displays either long-range transport or is localized in a finite region. We show that there are transitions from two localized states to a diffusive state each driven by an underlying static percolation transition. We determine the non-equilibrium state diagram and calculate the mean-square displacements and diffusivities by computer simulations. Close to the transition lines transport becomes subdiffusive which is rationalized as a dynamic critical phenomenon.}}

	abstract = {We examine skyrmions interacting with a square array of obstacles under ac drives applied in one or two directions. For a single direction of ac driving, we find that the Magnus force in conjunction with the obstacle interactions can create elliptical skyrmion orbits of increasing size, leading to localized phases, chaotic phases, and translating or ratcheting orbits. Under two ac drives that are out of phase by 90° and applied in two directions, the skyrmions form localized commensurate orbits that encircle an integer number of obstacles, similar to the electron pinball effect observed for electrons in antidot lattices. As a function of ac amplitude, Magnus force strength, and obstacle size, we find that chaotic scattering regimes and directed motion can emerge even in the absence of asymmetry in the substrate. The directed motion follows different symmetry axes of the periodic substrate, and we observe a variety of reversed ratchet effects. The Magnus force in the skyrmion system produces a significantly larger number of directed motion regimes than are exhibited by overdamped systems. We discuss how these results could be used to move skyrmions in a controlled way for possible applications.}

	Abstract = {The adult human bronchial tree is covered with a continuous layer of epithelial cells that play a critical role in maintaining the conduit for air, and which are central to the defenses of the lung against inhaled environmental concomitants. The epithelial sheet functions as an interdependent unit with the other lung components. Importantly, the structure and/or function of airway epithelium is deranged in major lung disorders, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and bronchogenic carcinoma. Investigations regarding the airway epithelium have led to many advances over the past few decades, but new developments in genetics and stem cell/progenitor cell biology have opened the door to understanding how the airway epithelium is developed and maintained, and how it responds to environmental stress. This article provides an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding airway epithelial stem/progenitor cells, gene expression, cell-cell interactions, and less frequent cell types, and discusses the challenges for future areas of investigation regarding the airway epithelium in health and disease.},

title = {Hydrodynamic capture of microswimmers into sphere-bound orbits",
abstract = "Self-propelled particles can exhibit surprising non-equilibrium behaviors, and how they interact with obstacles or boundaries remains an important open problem. Here we show that chemically propelled micro-rods can be captured, with little change in their speed, into close orbits around solid spheres resting on or near a horizontal plane. We show that this interaction between sphere and particle is short-range, occurring even for spheres smaller than the particle length, and for a variety of sphere materials. We consider a simple model, based on lubrication theory, of a force- and torque-free swimmer driven by a surface slip (the phoretic propulsion mechanism) and moving near a solid surface. The model demonstrates capture, or movement towards the surface, and yields speeds independent of distance. This study reveals the crucial aspects of activity-driven interactions of self-propelled particles with passive objects, and brings into question the use of colloidal tracers as probes of active matter.},

Recent advances in synthetic micro/nanomachines have opened new horizons for addressing environmental problems. This review article highlights the opportunities and challenges in translating the remarkable progresses in nanomotor technology toward practical environmental applications. It covers various environmental areas that would benefit from these developments, including nanomachine-enabled degradation and removal of major contaminants or nanomotor-based water quality monitoring. Future operations of autonomous intelligent multifunctional nanomachines, monitoring and responding to hazardous chemicals (in a "sense and destroy" mode) and using bioinspired chemotactic search strategies to trace chemical plumes to their source, are discussed, along with the challenges of moving these exciting research efforts to larger-scale pilot studies and eventually to field applications. With continuous innovations, we expect that man-made nano/microscale motors will have profound impact upon the environment.},

abstract = {In recent times, numerous efforts have been put forward to fabricating the self-propelling micro-/nano-motors (MNMs) for various applications, such as drug delivery, environmental remediation, biosensing, and precision surgery at the micro-/nanoscale, among others. Owing to their potential advantages, the application of such innovative architectures has been increasingly recognized towards addressing various challenges in the related fields. Specifically, these MNMs offer enormous potential in nanomedicine in overcoming the significant challenge of low permeation of the biological barriers. Herein, we emphasize the powered mechanism of MNMs, including artificial and natural-based MNMs, and discuss the characteristics, as well as the challenges being faced by MNMs in drug delivery. Further, the research progress of MNMs as drug carriers in different environments (gastrointestinal tract, saliva, urinary bladder, blood, and extracellular matrix, ECM) of the body in recent years is summarized, highlighting the representative works on MNMs towards in vivo applications. Together, we firmly believe that these innovative MNMs-based designs may play a crucial role in the clinical practice in the future.}

title = {A geometric criterion for the optimal spreading of active polymers in porous media},
abstract = "Efficient navigation through disordered, porous environments poses a major challenge for swimming microorganisms and future synthetic cargo-carriers. We perform Brownian dynamics simulations of active stiff polymers undergoing run-reverse dynamics, and so mimic bacterial swimming, in porous media. In accord with experiments of Escherichia coli, the polymer dynamics are characterized by trapping phases interrupted by directed hopping motion through the pores. Our findings show that the spreading of active agents in porous media can be optimized by tuning their run lengths, which we rationalize using a coarse-grained model. More significantly, we discover a geometric criterion for the optimal spreading, which emerges when their run lengths are comparable to the longest straight path available in the porous medium. Our criterion unifies results for porous media with disparate pore sizes and shapes and for run-and-tumble polymers. It thus provides a fundamental principle for optimal transport of active agents in densely-packed biological and environmental settings.",

abstract = {Adopting the right search strategy is of critical importance in a broad range of natural and man-related activities. For example, when foraging in an environment with scarce resources, the search strategy used by animals to look for nourishment is a matter of life or death. It is generally accepted that, under most conditions, the optimal strategy alternates ballistic and diffusive steps. This, however, does not take into account that many search spaces feature complex topographies with boundaries, barriers, and obstacles. Here, we show that the presence of such complexity shifts the optimal strategy toward less ballistic and more diffusive searches. In environments with scarce resources, adopting the right search strategy can make the difference between succeeding and failing, even between life and death. At different scales, this applies to molecular encounters in the cell cytoplasm, to animals looking for food or mates in natural landscapes, to rescuers during search and rescue operations in disaster zones, and to genetic computer algorithms exploring parameter spaces. When looking for sparse targets in a homogeneous environment, a combination of ballistic and diffusive steps is considered optimal; in particular, more ballistic Lévy flights with exponent α≤1 are generally believed to optimize the search process. However, most search spaces present complex topographies. What is the best search strategy in these more realistic scenarios? Here, we show that the topography of the environment significantly alters the optimal search strategy toward less ballistic and more Brownian strategies. We consider an active particle performing a blind cruise search for nonregenerating sparse targets in a 2D space with steps drawn from a Lévy distribution with the exponent varying from α=1 to α=2 (Brownian). We show that, when boundaries, barriers, and obstacles are present, the optimal search strategy depends on the topography of the environment, with α assuming intermediate values in the whole range under consideration. We interpret these findings using simple scaling arguments and discuss their robustness to varying searcher’s size. Our results are relevant for search problems at different length scales from animal and human foraging to microswimmers’ taxis to biochemical rates of reaction.}}
