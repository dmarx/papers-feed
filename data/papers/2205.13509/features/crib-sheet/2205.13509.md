- **Chiral Swimmers**: Defined as active Brownian particles or run-and-tumble dynamics; exhibit unique transport properties in heterogeneous environments.
  
- **Disorder Types**: 
  - **Dynamic Noise**: Perturbs swimmer's reorientation (rotational Brownian diffusion).
  - **Quenched Noise**: 
    - Positional disorder of obstacles.
    - Size polydispersity of obstacles.

- **Effective Diffusion Coefficient (D)**: Quantifies transport properties; calculated from mean square displacement (MSD):
  \[
  MSD(t) = [R(t) - R(0)]^2
  \]
  \[
  MSD(t) \sim 4Dt \quad (t \to \infty)
  \]

- **Obstacle Density (ρ)**: Expressed as:
  \[
  ρ = \frac{N_o \pi \sigma^2}{L^2} \times 100\%
  \]
  where \(N_o\) is the number of obstacles, \(\sigma\) is the obstacle diameter, and \(L\) is the simulation box size.

- **Weeks-Chandler-Anderson Potential**: Governs interactions between swimmer and obstacles:
  \[
  V(r_i) = 
  \begin{cases} 
  4\left(\frac{\sigma}{r_i}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r_i}\right)^{6} + 1 & \text{for } r_i < 2\sigma \\
  0 & \text{for } r_i \geq 2\sigma 
  \end{cases}
  \]

- **Trajectory Dynamics**: Governed by:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  \frac{dx}{dt} &= v \cos(\phi) + F_x \\
  \frac{dy}{dt} &= v \sin(\phi) + F_y \\
  \frac{d\phi}{dt} &= \omega + 2D_R \xi_\phi
  \end{align*}
  \]
  where \(F = -\nabla V\) and \(\xi_\phi\) is white noise.

- **Transport Behavior**:
  - At low obstacle densities, chiral motion is rectified, enhancing diffusion.
  - At high densities, swimmers become caged, reducing diffusivity.
  - Non-monotonic relationship between diffusivity and obstacle density observed.

- **Ideal Chiral Swimmer**: Moves in circular orbits in homogeneous environments; exhibits deterministic space exploration influenced by obstacle arrangement.

- **Noise Effects**: 
  - Increased dynamic noise enhances diffusivity at low densities but suppresses guided transport at high densities.
  - Quenched noise leads to erratic motion, disrupting fixed swimming orbits.

- **Simulation Parameters**: 
  - Typical simulation includes \(N_o = 400\) obstacles.
  - Time evolution simulated using a second-order Runge-Kutta scheme.
  - Step size \(\Delta t = 10^{-4}\) and total simulation time \(t = 4800 \sigma/v\).

- **Key Findings**: 
  - The presence of obstacles can enhance or hinder transport depending on the type and strength of disorder.
  - Rectification of chiral motion by obstacles can lead to efficient transport in disordered media.
