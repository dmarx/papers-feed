- **Chiral Swimmers**: Defined as active Brownian particles or run-and-tumble dynamics; exhibit unique transport properties in heterogeneous environments.
  
- **Effective Diffusion Coefficient (D)**: Quantifies transport properties; calculated from mean square displacement (MSD) using:
  \[
  MSD(t) \sim 4Dt, \quad t \to \infty
  \]

- **Obstacle Density (ρ)**: Expressed as:
  \[
  ρ = \frac{N_o \pi \sigma^2}{L^2} \times 100\%
  \]
  where \(N_o\) is the number of obstacles, \(\sigma\) is the diameter of the swimmer/obstacles, and \(L\) is the edge size of the simulation box.

- **Weeks-Chandler-Anderson Potential**: Governs interactions between swimmer and obstacles:
  \[
  V(r_i) = 
  \begin{cases} 
  4\left(\frac{\sigma}{r_i}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r_i}\right)^{6} + 1 & \text{for } r_i < 2\sigma \\
  0 & \text{for } r_i \geq 2\sigma 
  \end{cases}
  \]

- **Trajectory Dynamics**: Governed by:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  \frac{dx}{dt} &= v \cos(\phi) + F_x \\
  \frac{dy}{dt} &= v \sin(\phi) + F_y \\
  \frac{d\phi}{dt} &= \omega + 2D_R \xi_\phi
  \end{align*}
  \]
  where \(F = -\nabla V\) and \(\xi_\phi\) is white noise.

- **Types of Noise**:
  - **Dynamic Noise**: Perturbs swimmer's trajectory; characterized by rotational diffusion constant \(D_R\).
  - **Quenched Noise**: Includes positional disorder of obstacles and size polydispersity affecting obstacle dynamics.

- **Transport Dynamics**: 
  - At low obstacle densities, chiral motion is rectified, enhancing diffusion.
  - At high densities, swimmers become caged, leading to reduced diffusivity.

- **Non-monotonic Diffusivity**: Observed with increasing obstacle density; peaks at specific densities (e.g., ρ = 9.5%) due to optimal interaction with obstacles.

- **Simulation Parameters**: 
  - Typical number of obstacles \(N_o = 400\).
  - Simulation duration \(t = 4800 \sigma/v\).
  - Step size \(\Delta t = 10^{-4}\).

- **Mean Square Displacement (MSD)**: Calculated as:
  \[
  MSD(t) = [R(t) - R(0)]^2
  \]
  averaged over multiple trajectories to assess transport efficiency.

- **Rectification Mechanism**: Chiral swimmers can exploit obstacle arrangement to enhance transport, particularly in structured environments.

- **Implications**: Findings relevant for biomedical applications (e.g., drug delivery) and nanotechnology (e.g., self-propelled cargo carriers).
