\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec: conclusion}

In this paper, we have proposed a probabilistic Gaussian superposition model as an efficient object-centric representation.
Specifically, we interpret each Gaussian as a probability distribution of its neighborhood being occupied and adopt the multiplication theorem of probability to derive the geometry predictions.
And we employ the Gaussian mixture model formulation to calculate normalized semantics predictions.
We have also designed a distribution-based initialization strategy to effectively initialize Gaussians around occupied area for object-centric modeling according to pixel-aligned occupancy distribution.
Our GaussianFormer-2 has achieved state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and KITTI-360 datasets for 3D semantic occupancy prediction, which has also demonstrated improved efficiency compared with GaussianFormer on the number of Gaussians, position correctness and overlapping ratio.
