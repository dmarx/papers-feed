## 

• Input: "Context: … 'That's fantastic, I'm glad we came to something we both agree with.' Utterance: 'Me too. I hope you have a wonderful camping trip.'" • Output: "Yes" • Explanation: "The participant engages in small talk when wishing their opponent to have a wonderful trip."

• Input: "Context: … 'Sounds good, I need food the most, what is your most needed item?!' Utterance: 'My item is food too'." • Output: "Yes" • Explanation: "The utterance only takes the negotiation forward and there is no side talk. Hence, the correct answer is 'No'." Definition "... Given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available), output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the small-talk strategy, otherwise output 'No'. Small-talk is a cooperative negotiation strategy. It is used for discussing topics apart from the negotiation, to build a rapport with the opponent."
