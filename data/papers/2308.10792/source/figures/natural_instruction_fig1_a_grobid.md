Instructions for MC-TACO question generation task -Title: Writing questions that involve commonsense understanding of "event duration".

-Definition: In this task, we ask you to write a question that involves ?event duration", based on a given sentence. Here, event duration is defined as the understanding of how long events typically last. For example, ?brushing teeth?, usually takes few minutes.

-Emphasis & Caution: The written questions are not required to have a single correct answer.

-Things to avoid: Don't create questions which have explicit mentions of answers in text. Instead, it has to be implied from what is given. In other words, we want you to use "instinct" or "common sense".

-Input: Sentence: Jack played basketball after school, after which he was very tired.

-Output: How long did Jack play basketball? -Reason: the question asks about the duration of an event; therefore it's a temporal event duration question.

-Output: How long did he do his homework? -Reason: We DO NOT want this question as the answer is directly mentioned in the text. -Suggestion: -Negative Example -Prompt: Ask a question on "event duration" based on the provided sentence.
