- **Problem Addressed**: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) leading to factually inaccurate content.
  
- **Proposed Solution**: Ewe (Explicit Working Memory) integrates a working memory that receives real-time feedback from external resources to enhance factuality in long-form text generation.

- **Key Mechanism**: 
  - Ewe maintains a memory of k relevant text chunks, allowing the model to attend to multiple sources of information in parallel.
  - Memory is refreshed based on online fact-checking and retrieval feedback during the generation process.

- **Memory Update Process**:
  - Ewe pauses generation to check the accuracy of newly generated sentences.
  - If inaccuracies are found, the memory is updated with correct information and the generation process backtracks to the last valid state.

- **Factuality Metric**: 
  - Ewe improves the VeriScore metric by 2 to 10 points absolute across four fact-seeking long-form generation datasets.

- **Comparison with RAG**: 
  - Unlike traditional RAG, which uses a single retrieval step, Ewe employs a memory-augmented approach allowing for dynamic updates and multiple feedback streams.

- **Memory Design**:
  - Memory consists of multiple units, enabling selective updates and efficient reuse of information.
  - Each memory unit can be updated, appended, or deleted based on relevance.

- **Real-time Feedback Types**:
  - **Fact-checking Outcomes**: Correct information that refutes inaccuracies.
  - **Relevant Knowledge**: Retrieved passages based on the input question and the sentence being fact-checked.

- **Algorithm Overview**:

      A[Start Generation] --> B[Generate Sentence]
      B --> C{Check Factuality}
      C -->|Correct| D[Continue Generation]
      C -->|Incorrect| E[Retrieve Correct Facts]
      E --> F[Update Memory]
      F --> G[Backtrack and Regenerate]
      G --> D
  ```

- **Empirical Results**: Ewe demonstrates improved factuality without sacrificing helpfulness compared to the base model Llama-3.1 70B.

- **Related Work**: Ewe builds on existing methods like FLARE and Self-RAG, enhancing their capabilities with explicit memory and adaptive retrieval mechanisms.
