- **Monarch Matrix Definition**: A Monarch matrix \( M \) is defined as \( M = PLPR \), where \( L \) and \( R \) are block-diagonal matrices, \( P \) is a permutation matrix, and \( n = m^2 \) (Definition 3.1).

- **Parameterization**: Each Monarch matrix is parameterized as the product of two block-diagonal matrices, enhancing hardware efficiency on GPUs.

- **Expressiveness**: Monarch matrices can represent many commonly used transforms (e.g., Fourier, convolution) and inherit expressiveness from butterfly matrices (Proposition 3.2).

- **Analytical Optimal Solution**: The problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix has an analytical optimal solution, despite being nonconvex (Theorem 1).

- **Efficiency Gains**: Monarch matrices yield up to 2× speedup in end-to-end training compared to dense matrix multiplication (Section 5.1.1).

- **Sparse-to-Dense Training**: The "reverse sparsification" technique allows for efficient transition from sparse to dense models, speeding up training processes (Section 5.2).

- **Dense-to-Sparse Fine-Tuning**: Monarch's projection algorithm enables efficient fine-tuning of pretrained models, achieving 1.7× faster BERT fine-tuning on GLUE with comparable accuracy (Section 5.3).

- **Empirical Validation**: Monarch matrices achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs, demonstrated by:
  - 2× faster training of ViT on ImageNet and GPT-2 on Wikitext-103 with similar accuracy.
  - 40% error reduction in PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks compared to Fourier-based methods.
  - 23% faster BERT pretraining than Nvidia's optimized implementation.

- **Related Work**: Monarch matrices differ from traditional sparse training methods (e.g., pruning, lottery tickets) by focusing on overall efficiency rather than just inference efficiency.

- **Butterfly Matrices**: Monarch matrices build on butterfly matrices, which can represent structured matrices with optimal parameters and runtime complexity (Section 2).

- **Projection Algorithm**: The derived projection algorithm for Monarch matrices allows for tractable approximation of dense matrices, facilitating their use in various applications (Section 3.3).
