\section{Notation Review}
Throughout this paper, we use lowercase to denote scalars (e.g., $k$), lowercase boldface to denote vectors (e.g., $\vv$), and uppercase boldface to denote matrices (e.g., $\vA$).

$\vI$ denotes the identity matrix. We use $\vA^\top$ to denote the transpose of a matrix and $\vA^*$ to denote the conjugate transpose of a matrix. All results in this paper apply to matrices over the either the reals $\mathbb{R}$ or the complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$; when the field under consideration can be either one of these, we denote it by $\mathbb{F}$.

We use 1-indexing throughout this paper except where explicitly stated.
