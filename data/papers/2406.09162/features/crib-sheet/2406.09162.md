- **Model Overview**: EMMA is a multi-modal image generation model built on the ELLA text-to-image diffusion model, designed to effectively integrate multiple modalities (text and images) without compromising the control of text conditions.

- **Key Innovation**: Introduces the Assemblable Gated Perceiver Resampler (AGPR) which utilizes cross-attention to merge additional modalities into text features, allowing for flexible and complex input combinations.

- **Parameter Freezing**: All parameters of the original ELLA model are frozen during training, ensuring that the model retains its text control capabilities while adapting to new modalities.

- **Multi-modal Prompt Handling**: EMMA can accept and process multi-modal prompts seamlessly, enabling the generation of images conditioned on various inputs (e.g., text and facial features) without additional training.

- **Compatibility**: EMMA is designed as a plug-and-play module compatible with existing diffusion models, particularly the Stable Diffusion framework, allowing for easy integration into various applications.

- **Performance**: Extensive experiments demonstrate EMMA's ability to maintain high fidelity and detail in generated images, showcasing robustness against different control signals.

- **Modular Assembly**: The architecture allows for the modular assembly of models conditioned on different modalities, facilitating efficient adaptation to new tasks without retraining.

- **Applications**: EMMA supports diverse applications, including personalized image generation, artistic portrait creation, and subject-driven video generation.

- **Attention Mechanism**: The AGPR employs a gate mechanism to control the integration of information from different modalities, enhancing the model's ability to balance multiple conditions during image generation.

- **Related Work**: EMMA builds upon advancements in text-to-image diffusion models and addresses limitations in existing multi-modal image generation approaches, such as bias towards easier conditions.

- **Future Directions**: Potential for further exploration in enhancing multi-modal training datasets and improving the balance of condition influences in image generation tasks.
