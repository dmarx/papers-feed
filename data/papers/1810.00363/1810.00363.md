This work was supported by the ERC grant number 714381 (SOLARIS project) and by the MSR-Inria joint centre.

Section  of this supplementary presents extended results from our experiments, along with statistical tests for assessing the significance of our findings. Section  details our lower bound penalties based on deformations and their relationship to tangent propagation. Section  presents our continuation algorithm for optimization with spectral norm constraints. Section  describes heuristic extensions of our lower bound regularization strategies to non-Euclidian geometries. Finally, Section  provides our proof of the margin bound of Proposition  for adversarial generalization.
