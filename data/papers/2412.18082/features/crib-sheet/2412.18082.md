- **Item Cold-start Problem**: Critical phase in online recommender systems where new items lack prior interactions, affecting their popularity potential.
  
- **Pinnacle Feedback**: High-value positive feedback proposed as prompt information to enhance cold-start recommendations, addressing semantic gaps and model bias.

- **Prompt-tuning Method (PROMO)**: A novel approach that utilizes pinnacle feedback for cold-start items, incorporating personalized prompt networks to improve model performance.

- **Key Contributions**:
  - Identification of data cost and model bias challenges in cold-start recommendations.
  - Introduction of soft prompts for flexible application and avoidance of extra annotation costs.
  - Development of two types of prompt-enhanced loss functions to improve recommendation quality.

- **Model Architecture**:
  - **Embedding Layer**: Transforms item ID and content features into low-dimensional vectors for input into the model.
  - **Backbone Model**: Utilizes SASRec (or other models) to encode user behavior sequences through stacked Transformer blocks.
  
- **Prediction Mechanism**: 
  - User-item interaction prediction formulated as:
    \[
    ŷ_{u,i} = \sigma [h_u]^T \cdot h_i \cdot \tau
    \]
    where \( \sigma \) is the sigmoid function, and \( \tau \) is the temperature coefficient.

- **Loss Function**: 
  - Negative log-likelihood defined as:
    \[
    L = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{(u,i,y) \in D_{train}} \left( y_{u,i} \log ŷ_{u,i} + (1 - y_{u,i}) \log(1 - ŷ_{u,i}) \right)
    \]

- **Experimental Validation**: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate PROMO's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in cold-start scenarios.

- **Real-world Application**: Successful deployment of PROMO on a billion-user scale short-video sharing platform, achieving significant performance improvements.

- **Related Works**: Overview of hybrid recommender systems addressing cold-start scenarios, including content-based methods, collaborative filtering, meta-learning, and transfer learning approaches.

- **Notation**: 
  - Vectors: boldface lowercase (e.g., \( \mathbf{e} \))
  - Matrices: boldface uppercase (e.g., \( \mathbf{W} \))
  - Sets: calligraphic capital letters (e.g., \( \mathcal{D} \))
  - User and item sets: \( U, I \)

- **Model Bias Issue**: Cold-start items receive less positive feedback, leading to poor model performance compared to warm-start items, necessitating personalized prompt networks.
