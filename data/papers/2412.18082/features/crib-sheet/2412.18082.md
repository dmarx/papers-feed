- **Item Cold-start Problem**: Critical phase in online recommender systems where new items lack prior interactions, affecting their popularity potential.
  
- **Pinnacle Feedback**: High-value positive feedback proposed as prompt information to enhance cold-start recommendations by bridging semantic gaps and reducing model bias.

- **PROMO Framework**: A prompt-tuning method designed for item cold-start recommendations, utilizing pinnacle feedback and personalized prompt networks to improve model performance.

- **Key Contributions**:
  - Identification of challenges in prompt-tuning for cold-start recommendations: data cost and model bias.
  - Introduction of soft prompts for flexible application and avoidance of extra annotation costs.
  - Development of personalized prompt networks to adaptively update item representations and mitigate bias towards warm-start items.

- **Loss Functions**:
  - **Negative Log-Likelihood Loss**: 
    \[
    L = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{(u,i,y) \in D_{train}} \left( y_{u,i} \log \hat{y}_{u,i} + (1 - y_{u,i}) \log(1 - \hat{y}_{u,i}) \right)
    \]
  - **Prompt-enhanced Losses**: Introduced to boost performance on cold-start items.

- **Model Architecture**:
  - **Embedding Layer**: Transforms item ID and content features into low-dimensional vectors for input into the model.
  - **Backbone Model**: Utilizes SASRec with Transformer blocks to encode user behavior sequences, producing hidden representations for users and items.

- **Prediction Function**:
  \[
  \hat{y}_{u,i} = \sigma \left( [h_u]^T \cdot h_i \cdot \tau \right)
  \]
  where \( \sigma \) is the sigmoid function, \( \tau \) is the temperature coefficient, and \( h_u, h_i \) are the hidden representations of user and item.

- **Experimental Validation**: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate PROMO's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in cold-start scenarios.

- **Real-world Application**: Successful deployment of PROMO on a billion-user scale short-video sharing platform, achieving significant performance improvements across various metrics.
