% \dq{@Tianqi, Weijie, Daquan}
One of the key metrics for video generative models is their ability to follow text prompts accurately. This capability is essential for the effectiveness of these models. However, some open-source models often struggle to capture all subjects or accurately represent the relationships between multiple subjects, particularly when the input text prompt is complex.

\nameofmethod{} demonstrates robust capabilities in generating videos that closely adhere to the provided text prompts. As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:text-align}, it effectively manages multiple subjects within the scene.
