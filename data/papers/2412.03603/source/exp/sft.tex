Ahead, a sports car speeds around a corner, its tires violently skidding against the wet road, creating a mist of water.

The camera swiftly shifts to the side of the car, capturing the wheels spinning at high speed, before finally moving to the rear.}

In this part, we demonstrate \nameofmethod{}'s capabilities in producing high-dynamic videos based on given prompts. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:high_motion}, our model excels in generating videos that encompass a wide range of scenes and various types of motion.

\myPara{Concept Generalization}
% \dq{@Daquan, Zhiyu}
One of the most desirable features of a generative model is its ability to generalize concepts. As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:concept}, the text prompt describes a scene: "In a distant galaxy, an astronaut floats on a shimmering, pink, gemstone-like lake that reflects the vibrant colors of the surrounding sky, creating a stunning scene. The astronaut gently drifts on the lake's surface, while the soft sounds of water whisper the planet's secrets. He reaches out, his fingertips gliding over the cool, smooth water." Notably, this specific scenario has not been encountered in the training dataset. Furthermore, it is evident that the depicted scene combines several concepts that are also absent from the training data.
