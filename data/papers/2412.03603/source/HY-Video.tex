\begin{abstract}
Recent advancements in video generation have profoundly transformed daily life for individuals and industries alike. However, the leading video generation models remain closed-source, creating a substantial performance disparity in video generation capabilities between the industry and the public community. 
%
In this report, we present \nameofmethod{}, a novel open-source video foundation model that exhibits performance in video generation that is comparable to, if not superior to, leading closed-source models. \nameofmethod{} features a comprehensive framework that integrates several key contributions, including data curation, advanced architecture design, progressive model scaling and training, and an efficient infrastructure designed to facilitate large-scale model training and inference.
%
With those, we successfully trained a video generative model with over 13 billion parameters, making it the largest among all open-source models. 
%
We conducted extensive experiments and implemented a series of targeted designs to ensure high visual quality, motion dynamics, text-video alignment, and advanced filming techniques. According to professional human evaluation results, \nameofmethod{} outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including Runway Gen-3, Luma 1.6, and 3 top performing Chinese video generative models. By releasing the code of the foundation model and its applications, we aim to bridge the gap between closed-source and open-source communities. This initiative will empower everyone in the community to experiment with their ideas, fostering a more dynamic and vibrant video generation ecosystem. The code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo}.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

With extensive pre-training and advanced architectures, diffusion models~\cite{li2024hunyuandit,peebles2023scalable,esser2024scaling,rombach2022high,blattmann2023stable,girdhar2023emu,polyak2024movie,FLUX} have demonstrated superior performance in generating high-quality images and videos compared to previous generative adversarial network (GAN) methods \citep{brock2018large}.
However, unlike the image generation field, which has seen a proliferation of novel algorithms and applications across various open platforms, diffusion-based video generative models remain relatively inactive. We contend that one of the primary reasons for this stagnation is the lack of robust open-source foundation models as in T2I filed \cite{FLUX}. In contrast to the image generative model community, a significant gap has emerged between open-source and closed-source video generation models. Closed-source models tend to overshadow publicly available open-source alternatives, severely limiting the potential for algorithmic innovation from the public community. While the recent state-of-the-art model MovieGen \cite{polyak2024movie} has demonstrated promising performance, its milestone for open-source release has yet to be established.

\end{figure}

To address the existing gap and enhance the capabilities of the public community, this report presents our open-sourced foundational video generative model, \nameofmethod{}. This systematic framework encompasses training infrastructure, data curation, model architecture optimization, and model training.
%
Through our experiments, we discovered that randomly scaling the training data, computational resources, and model parameters of a simple Transformer-based generative model \cite{peebles2023scalable} trained with Flow Matching \cite{lipman2022flow} was not sufficiently efficient. Consequently, we explored an effective scaling strategy that can reduce computational resource requirements by up to 5× while achieving the desired model performance. With this optimal scaling approach and dedicated infrastructure, we successfully trained a large video model comprising 13 billion parameters, pre-training it on internet-scale images and videos.
%
After a dedicated progressive fine-tuning strategy, \nameofmethod{} excels in four critical aspects of video generation: visual quality, motion dynamics, video-text alignment, and semantic scene cut. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of \nameofmethod{} with leading global video generation models, including Gen-3 and Luma 1.6 and 3 top performing commercial models in China, using over 1,500 representative text prompts accessed by a group of 60 people. The results indicate that \nameofmethod{} achieves the highest overall satisfaction rates, particularly excelling in motion dynamics.

    \item In \textbf{Section \ref{sec:accelerate}}, we discuss methods for accelerating model training and inference, enabling the development of a large model with 13 billion parameters.
    \item \textbf{Section \ref{sec:exp}} evaluates the performance of our text-to-video foundation models and compares them with state-of-the-art video generation models, both open-source and proprietary.
    \item Finally, in \textbf{Section \ref{sec:application}}, we showcase various applications built on the pre-trained foundation model, accompanied by relevant visualizations as well as some video related functional models such as video to audio generative model.

Text prompts are encoded using a large language model, and used as the condition. Gaussian noise and condition are taken as input, our model generates a output latent, which is decoded into images or videos through the 3D VAE decoder.}

\section{Related Works}
\label{sec:related_works}

Due to the success of diffusion models in the field of image generation~\citep{rombach2022high, ho2020denoising}, the exploration in the domain of video generation~\citep{guo2023animatediff,jiang2023text2performer,singer2022make,wang2023lavie,yang2023probabilistic,zhang2023show,ma2024follow,chen2024follow,xue2024follow,ma2024follow2} is also becoming popular. VDM~\citep{ho2022video} is among the first that extends the 2D U-Net from image diffusion models to a 3D U-Net to achieve text-based generation.
%
Later works, such as MagicVideo~\citep{zhou2023magicvideo} and Mindscope~\citep{wang2023modelscope}, introduce 1D temporal attention mechanisms, reducing computations by building upon latent diffusion models. In this report, we do not use the 2D + 1D temporal block manner for motion learning. Instead, we use similar dual flow attention blocks as in FLUX \cite{FLUX}, which are used for processing all video frames.
%
Following Imagen, Imagen Video~\citep{ho2022imagen} employs a cascaded sampling pipeline that generates videos through multiple stages.
%
In addition to traditional end-to-end text-to-video (T2V) generation, 
video generation using other conditions is also an important direction.
%
This type of methods generates videos with other auxiliary controls, such as depth maps~\citep{guo2023sparsectrl,he2023animate}, pose maps~\citep{xu2023magicanimate,hu2023animate,wang2023disco,ma2023follow}, RGB images~\citep{blattmann2023stable,chen2023seine,ni2023conditional}, or other guided motion videos~\citep{zhao2023motiondirector,wu2023lamp}.  
%
Despite the excellent generation performance of the recent open-source models such as Stable video diffusion~\citep{blattmann2023stable}, Open-sora \cite{opensora}, Open-sora-plan \cite{pku_yuan_lab_and_tuzhan_ai_etc_2024_10948109}, Mochi-1 \cite{genmo2024mochi} and Allegro \cite{zhou2024allegro}, their performance still falls far behind the closed-source
%
state-of-the-art video generation models such as Sora \cite{videoworldsimulators2024} and MovieGen \cite{polyak2024movie}.
