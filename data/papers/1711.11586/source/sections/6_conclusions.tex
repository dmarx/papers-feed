In conclusion, we have evaluated a few methods for combating the problem of mode collapse in the conditional image generation setting. We find that by combining multiple objectives for encouraging a bijective mapping between the latent and output spaces, we obtain results which are more realistic and diverse. We see many interesting avenues of future work, including directly enforcing a distribution in the latent space that encodes semantically meaningful attributes to allow for image-to-image transformations with user controllable parameters.
