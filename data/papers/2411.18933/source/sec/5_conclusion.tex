We revisited using a plain, non-hierachical image encoder for building efficient video object segmentation and track anything model, EfficientTAM. With a vanilla lightweight ViT image encoder, EfficientTAM demonstrated competing image and video segmentation capabilities as hierarchical image encoder while being more efficient and deployable on mobile devices. We also proposed an efficient memory module with faster cross-attention, leveraging the locality of spatial memory embeddings. The efficient memory module further improves EfficientTAM's accuracy-efficiency tradeoff on video segmentation and tracking anything. Extensive experiments on semi-supervised video object segmentation, promptable video segmentation, and the segment anything tasks consistently validate the advantages of our EfficientTAM. Our preliminary work suggests that EfficientTAM has many potential applications for on-device tracking anything.
