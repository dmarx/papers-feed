- **First Return Map (FRM)**: A discrete map derived from the first return of an orbit to a Poincaré section, connecting successive intersection points.
  
- **Poincaré Section**: An n-1 dimensional surface transverse to the flow of a dynamical system, where orbits intersect to create the FRM.

- **Ordinal Partition Networks (OPN)**: A method to generate a network representation of a time series by partitioning it into ordinal sequences based on relative order.

- **Ordinal Partitioning**: Two methods:
  - **Amplitude Ranking**: Ranks points based on their amplitude.
  - **Chronological Index Ranking**: Ranks points based on their time index.

- **Entropy-based Measures**: Used to evaluate and select the best ordinal sequences for constructing effective FRMs.

- **Algorithm Steps**:
  1. Define a window of length \( L \) over the time series.
  2. Generate ordinal partitions \( o(i) \) for each window.
  3. Create a weighted directed graph representing transitions between ordinal states.
  4. Calculate entropy for each OPN to rank the ordinal partitions.

- **Noise Resistance**: The method is robust against noise due to its reliance on ordinal data rather than raw time series values.

- **Applications**: Successfully applied to chaotic systems like Lorenz, Rössler, and Mackey-Glass, demonstrating the ability to reconstruct underlying dynamics from scalar time series.

- **Comparison with Traditional Methods**: Unlike embedding techniques (e.g., Takens' theorem), this method does not require full access to the attractor or complex numerical models, making it computationally efficient.

- **Key Equations**:
  - Window size: \( L = (m - 1) \tau \)
  - Number of windows: \( N - (m - 1) \tau \)

  - **Figure 2**: Depicts the structure of an OPN generated from a sampled time series.

- **Future Work**: Explore the application of this method to more complex and higher-dimensional systems, and investigate the impact of different parameters on the quality of the FRM.
