- **State Space Models (SSMs)**: Achieve state-of-the-art performance in various domains but lag behind Transformers in language modeling due to expressivity gaps and hardware inefficiencies.

- **Expressivity Gap**: SSMs struggle with recalling earlier tokens and comparing tokens across sequences, which are critical for language modeling.

- **H3 Layer (Hungry Hungry Hippo)**: A new SSM layer designed to address the expressivity gap by stacking two SSMs with multiplicative interactions. It matches attention on synthetic tasks and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText.

- **Hybrid H3-Attention Model**: A model combining H3 with two attention layers that outperforms Transformers by 1.0 PPL on OpenWebText.

- **FlashConv**: A novel algorithm that improves the efficiency of SSMs on modern hardware, utilizing a fused block FFT algorithm and a state-passing mechanism to handle longer sequences efficiently.

- **Performance Metrics**: FlashConv achieves 2× speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid models to generate text 2.4× faster than Transformers.

- **Scaling SSMs**: FlashConv enables scaling of hybrid H3-attention models up to 2.7B parameters, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming them in zero-and few-shot learning on SuperGLUE tasks.

- **Synthetic Language Tasks**: Two tasks (Induction Head and Associative Recall) highlight the limitations of existing SSMs and motivate the design of the H3 layer.

- **State-Space Representation**: Continuous-time and discrete-time representations are defined by differential equations, allowing SSMs to model sequences efficiently.

- **Key Equations**:
  - Continuous-time: 
    \[
    \dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), \quad y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t)
    \]
  - Discrete-time: 
    \[
    x_i = Ax_{i-1} + Bu_i, \quad y_i = Cx_i + Du_i
    \]

- **H3 Layer Output**: 
  \[
  O_i = Q \cdot SSM_{\text{diag}}(SSM_{\text{shift}}(K) \cdot V)
  \]
  where \(A\) is a shift matrix for the SSM.

- **FlashConv Algorithm**: 
  - Utilizes block FFT for convolution, improving hardware efficiency.
  - State passing allows processing of input in chunks, maintaining a recurrent state.

- **Performance Comparison**: H3 and FlashConv demonstrate significant improvements over traditional SSMs and Transformers in both speed and accuracy on language modeling tasks.
