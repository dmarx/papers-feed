    Left: \hthree stacks two discrete SSMs with shift and diagonal matrices and uses multiplicative interactions between input projections and their outputs to model comparisons between points in a sequence.
    Middle: \hthree can perform associative recall---which is easy for attention, but not existing SSMs.
    Right: \fastfft uses a new state-passing algorithm over fused block FFTConv to increase hardware efficiency of SSMs, allowing \hthree to scale to billion-parameter models.
