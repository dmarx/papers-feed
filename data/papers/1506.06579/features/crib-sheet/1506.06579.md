- **Key Contributions**:
  - Introduction of two visualization tools for understanding DNNs:
    1. Interactive visualization of activations in each layer of a trained convnet.
    2. Enhanced visualization of learned features via regularized optimization in image space.

- **Visualization Tool Features**:
  - Live plotting of activation values for each layer in response to user-provided images or videos.
  - Displays:
    - Forward activation values.
    - Preferred stimuli via gradient ascent.
    - Top images for each unit from the training set.
    - Deconvolution highlighting of top images.
    - Backward diffs computed via backpropagation or deconvolution.

- **Regularization Techniques**:
  - New regularization methods introduced to improve image clarity in visualizations:
    - L2-regularization.
    - Incorporation of natural-image priors.
    - Three additional forms of regularization that enhance interpretability.

- **Neural Network Understanding**:
  - DNNs are often viewed as "black boxes" due to their complexity and the large number of parameters (e.g., AlexNet has 60 million parameters).
  - Understanding intermediate layer computations is crucial for model improvement.

- **Research Directions**:
  - Investigating layer-wise computations and neuron interactions.
  - Differentiating between dataset-centric and network-centric approaches for neuron interpretation.

- **Activation Visualization**:
  - Example: Conv5 layer has size 256×13×13, visualized as 256 grayscale images arranged in a grid.
  - Local representations observed in certain layers (e.g., detectors for specific objects like text and faces).

- **Practical Implications**:
  - Tools are open source and compatible with Caffe DNN framework.
  - Can be used with pretrained networks or user-provided DNNs.

  - Zeiler & Fergus (2013) for deconvolutional techniques.
  - Simonyan et al. (2013) for gradient-based visualization methods.
  - Mahendran & Vedaldi (2014) for natural-image priors in optimization.

- **Visualization Insights**:
  - Localized feature detection in higher layers (conv4 and conv5).
  - Webcam input often leads to less confident predictions due to lack of training set coverage.
