- **Key Contributions**:
  - Introduction of two visualization tools for understanding DNNs:
    1. Interactive visualization of activations in each layer of a trained convnet.
    2. Enhanced visualization of learned features via regularized optimization in image space.

- **Visualization Tool Features**:
  - Live plotting of activations for user-provided images/videos.
  - Displays forward activation values, preferred stimuli via gradient ascent, and top images from the training set.
  - Deconvolution highlighting of top images and backward diffs computed via backpropagation.

- **Regularization Techniques**:
  - New regularization methods introduced to improve image clarity in visualizations.
  - Combination of L2-regularization and natural-image priors to produce recognizable images.

- **Understanding DNNs**:
  - DNNs are often considered "black boxes" due to their complexity and large number of parameters (e.g., AlexNet has 60 million parameters).
  - Insights gained from visualizations can inform architectural improvements and hyperparameter tuning.

- **Activation Visualization**:
  - Activations are visualized in a spatially informative manner, respecting the geometry of input data.
  - Example: Conv5 layer activations visualized as 256 separate 13x13 grayscale images.

- **Intuitive Findings**:
  - Local representations observed in certain layers (e.g., detectors for specific objects like text and faces).
  - Differences in classification confidence between static images and live webcam input.

- **Open Source Availability**:
  - Tools are open source and compatible with Caffe DNN framework.
  - Pre-trained DNN available for immediate use with optimized images for neuron activation.

- **Future Research Directions**:
  - Suggested exploration of local vs. distributed representations in DNNs.
  - Potential for further development of visualization tools to enhance understanding of DNN operations.
