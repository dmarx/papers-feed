\section{Conclusion}

HybridFlow is an RLHF framework that enables flexible representation and efficient execution of diverse RLHF algorithms. 
We propose a hybrid programming model that allows users to easily build RLHF dataflow in a few lines of code by encapsulating distributed computation of different LLMs into primitive APIs and hiding the complexity of data resharding among nodes. Our 3D-HybridEngine ensures efficient execution of training and generation of the actor model, with zero memory redundancy and significantly reduced communication overhead for model parameter resharding. Furthermore, our effective mapping algorithm optimizes GPU allocation and placement of models in the RLHF dataflow.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that HybridFlow achieves 1.53$\times$ to 20.57$\times$ speedup compared to state-of-the-art RLHF systems under various model sizes and cluster scales.
