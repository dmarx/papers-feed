- **Key Contributions**:
  - First analytic theory of creativity in convolutional diffusion models.
  - Identifies two inductive biases: locality and equivariance.
  - Develops the Equivariant Local Score (ELS) machine for predicting outputs without training.

- **Inductive Biases**:
  - **Locality**: Model's finite receptive field size limits influence to local patches.
  - **Equivariance**: Parameter sharing in convolutional layers ensures translation invariance.

- **Mechanism of Creativity**:
  - Creativity arises from the failure to learn the ideal score function, allowing for combinatorial mixing of local training patches.
  - ELS machine generates novel images by combining different local patches from the training set.

- **Mathematical Framework**:
  - Forward diffusion process transforms data distribution \( \pi_0(\phi) \) into isotropic Gaussian \( N(0, I) \).
  - Reverse flow defined by:
    \[
    -\phi_t = \gamma_t(\phi_t + s_t(\phi_t))
    \]
    where \( s_t(\phi) \) is the score function.

- **Score Function Dynamics**:
  - Ideal score function leads to memorization of training data.
  - The posterior belief distribution \( W_t(\phi|\phi) \) concentrates on training data, inhibiting creativity.

- **Analytic Solutions**:
  - Derives minimum mean squared error (MMSE) approximations to the ideal score function under locality and equivariance constraints.
  - Provides explicit analytic solutions for boundary-broken equivariant local score.

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - ELS machine predicts outputs of trained models (ResNets, UNets) with high accuracy:
    - Median \( r^2 \) values: 0.94 (CIFAR10), 0.91 (FashionMNIST), 0.90 (MNIST).
  - Predicts outputs of self-attention enabled UNets with median \( r^2 \approx 0.75 \) on CIFAR10.

- **Spatial Structure Generation**:
  - Trained diffusion models exhibit coarse-to-fine generation of spatial structure.
  - Image boundaries play a crucial role in anchoring generation.

- **Limitations and Observations**:
  - ELS machine reproduces spatial inconsistencies at fine scales (e.g., incorrect limb counts).
  - Highlights the role of excessive locality in generating artifacts during the reverse process.

- **Comparison with Self-Attention Models**:
  - ELS machine can partially predict outputs of models with self-attention, indicating a role for attention in achieving semantic coherence.

- **Future Directions**:
  - Foundation for studying more powerful attention-enabled diffusion models.
  - Potential exploration of other inductive biases and their effects on creativity in generative models.
