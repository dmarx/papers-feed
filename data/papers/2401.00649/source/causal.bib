The standard expressions for the restricted least squares estimator are not usable in the short rank case because they rely on the unrestricted estimator. But, in the presence of restrictions, the restricted least squares estimator may be computable even if the unrestricted estimator is not. Our derivation produces some additional, useful algebraic results for least squares computation.},
