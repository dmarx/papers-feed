- **gMLP Overview**: A simple network architecture based on MLPs with gating, achieving performance comparable to Transformers in language and vision tasks.
  
- **Key Findings**:
  - Self-attention is not critical for Vision Transformers; gMLP matches accuracy with fewer parameters.
  - gMLP achieves parity with Transformers on BERT pretraining perplexity and outperforms on some downstream NLP tasks.

- **Model Structure**:
  - gMLP consists of L blocks with identical size and structure.
  - Each block defined as:  
    \( Z = \sigma(XU), \quad Z = s(Z), \quad Y = ZV \)  
    where \( \sigma \) is an activation function (e.g., GeLU).

- **Spatial Gating Unit (SGU)**:
  - Captures spatial interactions using linear gating:  
    \( s(Z) = Z \cdot f_{W,b}(Z) \)  
    where \( f_{W,b}(Z) = WZ + b \) and \( W \) is independent of input representations.
  - Initialization: \( W \) near-zero, \( b \) as ones for training stability.

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - gMLP achieves 87.7% accuracy on MNLI and 82.1% F1 on SQuAD v2.0 with a standard training setup.
  - Performance gap with Transformers can be closed by increasing model size.

- **Image Classification**:
  - gMLP applied to ImageNet classification, showing competitive performance with ViT and DeiT.
  - Regularization techniques similar to DeiT are employed to mitigate overfitting.

- **Masked Language Modeling**:
  - gMLP follows BERT's input/output protocols without positional encodings or masking <pad> tokens.
  - Learns Toeplitz-like matrices for spatial weights, indicating shift invariance.

- **Ablation Studies**:
  - Comparison with various baselines, including BERT with Transformer architecture and learnable position embeddings.
  - Importance of gating in gMLP for effective pretraining and performance.

- **Conclusion**:
  - gMLP demonstrates that simpler spatial interaction mechanisms can be as effective as self-attention in scaling machine learning models.
