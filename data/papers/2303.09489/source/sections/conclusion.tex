\section{Conclusion}

We introduce \ourmethod{}, a state-space time series model. We achieve high expressivity by modeling SSMs with the companion matrix, long-horizon forecasting with a closed-loop SSM variant, and efficiency with a new algorithm to compute the companion SSM. We validate \ourmethod{}'s proposed components on extensive time series forecasting and classification tasks.
