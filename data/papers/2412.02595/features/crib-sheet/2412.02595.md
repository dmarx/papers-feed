- **Dataset Overview**: Nemotron-CC is a 6.3T token long-horizon pretraining dataset derived from English Common Crawl, consisting of 4.4T globally deduplicated original tokens and 1.9T synthetically generated tokens.

- **Key Contributions**:
  - Achieves a 5.6 MMLU improvement over DCLM with a 1.1T-token high-quality subset.
  - Matches DCLM performance while containing 4Ã— more unique real tokens.
  - An 8B parameter model trained on 15T tokens from this dataset outperforms Llama 3.1 in multiple benchmarks.

- **Methodology**:
  - **Classifier Ensembling**: Utilizes multiple model-based classifiers to enhance token quality selection.
  - **Synthetic Data Generation**: Employs rephrasing techniques to create diverse and high-quality data variants.
  - **Heuristic Filter Reduction**: Minimizes reliance on traditional heuristic filters to retain more high-quality tokens.

- **Quality Labeling Pipeline**:
  - Three classifiers are trained to score documents based on educational value, with scores rounded to integers from 0 to 19.
  - Documents are grouped into five quality categories based on downstream task performance.

- **Token Extraction and Filtering**:
  - **Extractors**: Justext and Trafilatura are evaluated, with Justext yielding more high-quality tokens (+28.6%).
  - **Deduplication**: Global fuzzy deduplication and exact substring deduplication are applied to enhance unique token yield.

- **Synthetic Data Generation Techniques**:
  - For low-quality data: Focus on reducing noise and errors through rephrasing.
  - For high-quality data: Generate diverse QA pairs, concise rewrites, and organized knowledge lists to enhance unique token representation.

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - MMLU: 70.3 for the 8B model trained on Nemotron-CC vs. 65.3 for Llama 3.1.
  - ARC-Challenge: +3.1 improvement over Llama 3.1.

- **Future Directions**: Emphasizes a learned flywheel approach where improved data quality leads to better LLM performance, which in turn enhances data quality.
