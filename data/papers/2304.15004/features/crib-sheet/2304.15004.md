- **Emergent Abilities Definition**: Abilities present in large-scale models but absent in smaller ones; cannot be predicted by extrapolating smaller model performance.
  
- **Key Properties of Emergent Abilities**:
  - **Sharpness**: Sudden transition from non-performance to performance at specific scales.
  - **Unpredictability**: Emergence occurs at unforeseeable model scales.

- **Alternative Explanation**: Emergent abilities may be artifacts of metric choice rather than fundamental model behavior changes. Nonlinear/discontinuous metrics induce sharp performance changes, while linear/continuous metrics yield smooth performance improvements.

- **Mathematical Model**:
  - Per-token cross-entropy loss as a function of model parameters \( N \):
    \[
    L_{CE}(N) = N^{c \alpha}
    \]
  - Probability of selecting the correct token:
    \[
    p(\text{single token correct}) = \exp\left(-L_{CE}(N)\right) = \exp\left(-\frac{N}{c}\alpha\right)
    \]
  - Accuracy metric for \( L \) tokens:
    \[
    \text{Accuracy}(N) \approx p(\text{single token correct})^L = \exp\left(-\frac{N}{c}\alpha L\right)
    \]

- **Metric Impact**:
  - Nonlinear metrics (e.g., Accuracy) lead to sharp, unpredictable performance changes.
  - Linear metrics (e.g., Token Edit Distance) reveal smooth, predictable improvements.

- **Predictions Tested**:
  1. Changing from nonlinear to linear metrics reveals smooth performance improvements.
  2. Increasing test dataset size improves resolution, revealing above-chance performance in smaller models.
  3. Performance predictably decreases with increasing target string length.

- **Meta-Analysis Findings**:
  - Emergent abilities appear predominantly with specific metrics, not across all task-model family pairs.
  - Changing metrics from nonlinear/discontinuous to linear/continuous removes emergent abilities.

- **Experimental Confirmation**:
  - InstructGPT/GPT-3 family shows emergent abilities under Accuracy but not under Token Edit Distance.
  - Increasing test data resolution reveals non-zero accuracy in smaller models, confirming metric influence.

- **Implications for AI Safety**: Understanding the nature of emergent abilities is crucial for predicting and controlling model behavior, especially regarding undesirable capabilities.
