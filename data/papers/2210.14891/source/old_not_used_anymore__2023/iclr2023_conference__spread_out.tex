DK ABSTRACT:
\dk{Neural scaling laws can be used to predict the results of large-scale training runs from smaller, cheaper experiments.  
A number of works have found that training loss scales smoothly and predictably as a function of data set size, parameter count, and training time.  
However, this masks a major limitation of existing scaling laws: they are not able to predict ``downstream'' performance of a model evaluated on new tasks or specific subsets of the training data, which often exhibits striking discontinuities} \ir{ not sure we should call the nonlinearities "discontinuities" - they are still continuous curves} \dk{, and can even decrease with scale.
Downstream performance is important as it can reflect particularly important properties of a model, such as TODO or truthfulness.
Our work proposes a new form of scaling law capable of fitting Todo discontinuities, ``inverse scaling'', and even double descent curves.
Traditional scaling laws are modified power laws, i.e.\ log(performance) is a linear function of log(scale).
Our new family of \textbf{broken neural scaling laws (BNSL)} are instead (roughly) \textit{piecewise} linear on a log-log plot.
% We show how to overcome optimization obstacles encountered when fitting such functions to empirical scaling data.
Our experiments demonstrate that this simple modification produces state-of-the-art extrapolations of both large scale and synthetic empirical scaling data.}

%\ir{Training state-of-the-art deep networks becomes highly expensive as the data and model size increase. Reliable prediction of their performance at scale is essential for selecting the most promising/cost-efficient architectures and algorithms. This triggered a recent surge in the literature on neural scaling laws that attempt to capture the performance (as well as other behaviors)   However, while the upstream (test set) performance typically follows a power law, no unifying scaling law were proposed yet for the downstream performance, which sometimes tends to exhibit non-linearities and sharp transitions (inflection points). }
% Why scaling laws?
IR abstract: \ir{Neural scaling laws aim to predict the behavior of large-scale models  from smaller, cheaper experiments, allowing to focus on the best-scaling architectures, algorithms, datasets, and so on. The upstream/in-distribution test loss typically (but not always!) falls off  as a power law with increasing  data, model size and compute. However, the downstream/out-of-distribution performance, and other evaluation metrics of interest (e.g., truthfulness in language models, etc) are often less predictable, exhibiting  nonlinear (e.g., sharp transitions, or ``grokking") and non-monotonic (inverse scaling, double descent etc) behaviors. Discovering {\it universal  scaling laws} that accurately model a wide range of potentially unexpected behaviors is clearly important not only for identifying that which scales best, but also for AI safety.

\section{Introduction}
%\vspace{-4.57mm}
The amount of compute used for training, number of model parameters, and training dataset size of the most capable artificial neural networks keeps increasing and will probably keep rapidly increasing for the foreseeable future. However, no organization currently has direct access to these larger resources of the future; and it has been empirically verified  many times that methods which perform best at smaller scales often are no longer the best performing methods at larger scales (e.g., one of such examples can be seen in  Figure 2 (right) of \cite{tolstikhin2021mlp}). To work on, identify, and steer the methods that are most probable to stand the test-of-time as these larger resources come online, one needs a way to predict how all relevant performance evaluation metrics of artificial neural networks vary in all relevant settings as scale increases.

Neural scaling laws \citep{cortes1994learning,2017arXiv171200409H,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1909-12673,icm2020arXiv200108361K,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2106-04560,abnar2021exploring,Alabdulmohsi2022revisiting, brown2020language, bahri2021explaining} aim to predict the behavior of large-scale models from smaller, cheaper experiments, allowing to focus on the best-scaling architectures, algorithms, datasets, and so on.

The constants in equation \ref{eq:BNSL} are interpreted as follows. Constant $n$ represents the number of (smooth) ``breaks" (i.e. transitions) between $n+1$ consecutive approximately linear (on a log-log plot) segments, for a total of $n+1$  approximately linear segments (on a log-log plot); 
when $n=0$, equation \ref{eq:BNSL} becomes $y=a+bx^{-c_0}$.
%Namely, this function is approximately piece-wise linear, since the  transitions between the linear segment are smoothly interpolated, unlike the non-smooth break points in  standard piece-wise linear functions.  
%A ``break" is defined as a transition between an interval that forms a straight line on a log-log plot and another interval that forms a straight line on a log-log plot.
%The graph of this function (in a log-log plot) is not exactly piece-wise linear; instead, it smoothly interpolates between the different approximately linear regions. 
%\todo{why is that good? possible answer: intuitively, any  smooth function (in log-log) can be approximated by a piece-wise linear function with a sufficient number of smoothly connected segments - the challenge is to find how many are needed.}
%Most of our experiments use $n=1$, but we also show that 
%TODO: explain that there are varying number of variables $d_i, f_i, g_i$ depending on the number of breaks in the functional form.
Constant $a$ represents the limit as to how far the value of $y$ (performance evaluation metric) can be reduced (or maximized) even if $x$ (the quantity being scaled) goes to infinity. Constant $b$ represents the offset of functional form on a log-log plot (analogous to the intercept $b$ in $y=mx+b$ on a linear-linear plot). Constant $c_0$ represents the slope of the first approximately linear region on a log-log plot. If there is a ``slope $=0$'' random guessing region \textbf{(often there is not)} at the beginning of the scaling behavior, $c_0=0$ and $random\_guessing\_per\hspace{-.6mm}f\hspace{-.6mm}ormance = b + a$. Constant $c_i$ represents the difference in slope of the $(i)$th approximately linear region and $(i+1)$th approximately linear region on a log-log plot. Constant $d_i$ represents where on the x-axis the break between the $(i)$th and the $(i+1)$th approximately linear region (on a log-log plot) occurs. %Constant $f_i$ represents the slope of the $(i+1)$th linear region on a log-log plot. Constant $g_i$ represents the sharpness of break between the $(i)$th and the $(i+1)$th linear region on a log-log plot.
Constant $f_i$ represents the sharpness of break between the $(i)$th and the $(i+1)$th approximately linear region on a log-log plot; smaller (nonnegative) values of $f_i$ yield a sharper break and intervals (before and after the $(i)$th break) that are more linear on a log-log plot; larger values of $f_i$ yield a smoother break and intervals (before and after the $(i)$th break) that are less linear on a log-log plot.

%Note that, while an intuition for using such smoothly connected approximately piece-wise linear (in log-log plot) function was that, with enough segments, it could fit well any smooth univariate scaling function, it remained unclear whether BNSL would also {\em extrapolate} well; yet as we demonstrate below, it extrapolates quite accurately. Additionally, we find that the number of breaks needed to accurately model an entire scaling behavior is often quite small.

% We show mathematically and empirically that previous functional forms are unable to express inflection points, and we show mathematically and empirically that our functional form is able to express inflection points.

%When the best fit of equation 1 converges to values of d much larger than 1, the functional form equation 1 seems to not be sufficient and will probably need to be replaced with a new functional form.

\section{Related Work}

To the best of our knowledge, \citet{cortes1994learning} was the first paper to model the scaling of multilayer neural network's performance as a power law (also known as a scaling law) (plus a constant)
%(also known as a scaling law) (plus a constant) \ir{[I would delete both those phrases in ()] } 
of the form $y=ax^b + c$ in which $x$ refers to training dataset size and $y$ refers to test error; we refer to that functional form as M2. \citet{2017arXiv171200409H} showed that the functional form, M2, holds over many orders of magnitude. \citet{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1909-12673} demonstrated  that the same functional form, M2, applies when $x$ refers to model size (number of parameters). \citet{icm2020arXiv200108361K} brought ``neural" scaling laws to the mainstream and demonstrated that the same functional form, M2, applies when $x$ refers to the amount of compute used for training. \citet{abnar2021exploring} proposed to use the same functional form, M2, to relate downstream performance to upstream performance. \citet{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2106-04560} and \cite{bansal2022data} introduced the functional form $y=a(x+d)^b + c$, (referred to by us as M3) where  $d$ represents the scale at which the performance starts to improve beyond the  random guess loss (a constant) and transitions to a  power law scaling regime. \citet{Alabdulmohsi2022revisiting} proposed functional form $(y - \epsilon_{\infty}) / ((\epsilon_{0} - y)^a) = bx^c$, (referred to by us as M4) where  $\epsilon_{\infty}$ is irreducible entropy of the data distribution and $\epsilon_{0}$ is random guess performance, for relating scale to performance and released a scaling laws benchmark dataset that we use in our experiments. %in section

%\todo[inline]{NEED TO TALK ABOUT HOW EQUATION 6.1 OF SCALING LAWS FOR TRANSFER (plus a trivial constant for irreducible entropy) IS MATHEMATICALLY EQUIVALENT TO BNSL}

%\citet{2021arXiv210201293H}  - this has full list of authors/too long/not the format used in biblio for a conference
%\citet{brown2020language}
\citet{2021arXiv210201293H} described a smoothly broken power law functional form (consisting of 5 constants after reducing redundant variables) in equation 6.1 of their paper, when relating scale and downstream performance. 
While this functional form can be summed with an additional constant representing unimprovable performance to obtain a functional form whose expressivity is equivalent to our BNSL with a single break, it is important to note that (i) \citet{2021arXiv210201293H} describes this form  only in the specific context, when exploring how  fine-tuning combined with transfer learning scales as a function of the model size - thus, their functional form contains a break only with respect to number of model parameters but not with respect to other input quantities which we do explore such as dataset size, amount of compute, and upstream performance; (ii) \citet{2021arXiv210201293H} mentioned this equation in passing and as a result did not try to fit or verify this functional form on any data; (iii) they arrived at it simply via combining the scaling law for transfer (that was the focus of their work) with a scaling law for pretraining data; (iv) they did not identify it as a smoothly broken power law, or note any qualitative advantages of this functional form; (v) they did not discuss the family of functional forms with multiple breaks. 

%\vspace{-1.6mm}

Finally, we would like to mention that smoothly broken power law functional forms, equivalent to equation \ref{eq:BNSL}, are commonly used in the astrophysics literature (e.g. \cite{dampe2017direct}) as they happen  to  model well a variety of physical phenomena. This inspired us to investigate their applicability to a wide range of deep neural scaling phenomena as well.

\section{Theoretical Limitations of Previously Proposed Scaling Laws}
\label{section:math_proofs}

%\todo[inline]{I'm not sure it's worth including any propositions in the main text.  The proofs are just basic calculus and algebra.}

%\todo[inline]{This is for M2.  Need to do M3 (and maybe M4) case as well.  Also need to know which one(s) to consider "standard" for framing.}

Our use of BNSLs is inspired by the observation that scaling is not always well predicted by a simple power law;
nor are many of the modifications which have been applied in previous works sufficient to capture the qualitative properties of empirical scaling curves.  
% In effect, the most sophisticated form common in previous work is a power law modified to incorporate a minimum achievable loss, representing irreducible entropy, and TODO.
Here we show mathematically two qualitative defects of these functional forms:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item They are strictly monotonic (first-order derivative does not change its sign) and thus unable to fit double descent phenomena.
    \item They cannot express inflection points (second-order derivative does not change its sign), which are frequently observed empirically.  An exception to this is M4, proposed by \citet{Alabdulmohsi2022revisiting}. %, which can model a single inflection point.
\end{enumerate}
Note that these functional forms \textit{can} exhibit inflection points on the log-log axes which are commonly used for plotting scaling data (as it was observed in several prior works).
However, for inflection points on a \textit{linear-linear} plot, the extra expressiveness of broken neural scaling laws appears to be necessary (and sufficient).
Figure~\ref{fig:double_descent} and Figure~\ref{fig:arithmetic}, provide examples of BNSLs producing non-monotonic behavior and inflection points, respectively, establishing the capacity of this functional form to model these phenomena that occur in real scaling behavior.

%\todo[inline]{TODO: fix claims of this section; and make sure claims everywhere in paper agree with claims here}

\noindent{\bf M1, M2, M3 functional forms cannot model non-monotonic behavior or inflection points:}  %We now explain why standard functional forms are incapable of exhibiting either behavior.
First, recall that expressions of the form $m^n$ can only take the value $0$ if $m=0$. 
We now examine the expressions for the first and second derivatives of M1, M2, M3, %M3',
provided in Table~\ref{tab:math}, and observe that they are all continuous and do not have roots over the relevant ranges of their variables, i.e.\ $x>0$ in general and $b<0$ in the case of M3 
%(we require $x > 0$ because the scaling variable (such as model size, dataset size, or amount of compute used) is always non-negative).
(we require $x > 0$ because model size, dataset size, and compute are always non-negative).
This implies that, for any valid settings of the parameters $a,b,c,d,x$, these functional forms are monotonic (as the first derivative never changes sign), and that they lack inflection points (since an inflection point must have $f''(x)=0$).

\noindent{\bf M4 functional form cannot model non-monotonic behavior.}  %We now 
The case of M4 is a bit different, since the relationship between $y$ and $x$ in this case is expressed as an inverse function, i.e.
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:M4}
x = g(y) = \left(\frac{y - \epsilon_{\infty}} {b(\epsilon_{0} - y)^a}\right)^{1/c}
\end{align}
However, non-monotonicity of $y$ as an inverse function $y = g^{-1}(x)$ is ruled out, since that would imply two different values of $x=g(y)$ can be obtained for the single value of $y$ -- this is impossible, since $f(y)$ maps each $y$ deterministically to a single value of $x$. As a result, M4 cannot express non-monotonic functions.
%As to the possibility of modeling an inflection point, we were yet not able to determine whether M4 has this capability or not.
%$a, b,c,e_0,e_{inf} = 1, 1, -2, .75, .25.$

\noindent{\bf M4 functional form can model inflection points.}  %We now 
%M4 is capable of expressive inflection points, however. 
It is easy to see that if $y=g^{-1}(x)$ had an inflection point, then $x = g(y)$ would have it as well. This is because an inflection point is defined as a point $x$ where $f(x)$ changes from concave to convex, which implies that $g(y)$ changes from convex to concave, since the inverse of a convex function is concave; the root(s) of $g''(y)$ are the point(s) at which this change occurs.
Using Wolfram Alpha\footnote{\href{https://www.wolframalpha.com/}{https://www.wolframalpha.com/}} and matplotlib \citep{Hunter:2007}, we observe that M4 is able to express inflection points, e.g.\ $(a,b,c,\epsilon_0, \epsilon_{\infty}, x, y) = (1,1,-2,3/4,1/4,1/\sqrt3, 5/8$), or $(a,b,c,\epsilon_0, \epsilon_{\infty}, x, y) = (2,1,-3,2/3,1/3,(-5/6 + \sqrt3/2)^{1/3}, 1/\sqrt3)$. % TODO: double check these (ideally someone else does that, to be extra sure)



% meaning M4 is capable of expressing an inflection point.
% Note also that when $a=1$, we can solve for M4 for $y$ in closed form, yielding the expression $y = \frac{h + j(bx)^c} {1 + (bx)^c}$.

%For $g''(y)$ to have a root we would need $y = (1-a) ((1+a)\epsilon_\infty - 2 \epsilon_0) =0 $; This can be achieved for $a=2, \epsilon_\infty=2/3, \epsilon_0=1$. 


% but this is impossible because we have $0 <\epsilon_\infty \leq \epsilon_0  < 1$ and $0<a<1$.
%However, it is easy to show via simple algebraic computation that  second derivative $g''(y)$ never equals zero, thus ruling out the possibility of inflection points with this functional form as well.

% An inflection point is a point of a curve at which the second order derivative (i.e.\ curvature) changes signs.

\label{section:functional_form_fits}

We now show the fits \& extrapolations of various functional forms. \textbf{In all plots here, onward, \& in the appendix, black points are points used for fitting a functional form, \textcolor{Green3}{green} (\textcolor{gray}{gray} if color blind) points are held-out points used for evaluating extrapolation of functional form fit to the black points, \& a \textcolor{red}{red} line is BNSL that has been fit to black points. 100\% of the plots in this paper here \& onward \& in the appendix contain \textcolor{Green3}{green} point(s) for evaluating extrapolation.} See Section \ref{section:BNSL_fit_details} for more details on fitting BNSL \& \textbf{determining the number of breaks}.

\vspace{-1.95mm}

\textbf{Except when stated otherwise}, each plot contains the region(s) surrounding (or neighboring) a single break of a BNSL fit to black points that are smaller (along the x-axis) than the green points.

% (TODO: this sentence is repeated in language section)

Using the scaling laws benchmark of \cite{Alabdulmohsi2022revisiting}, we evaluate how well various functional forms extrapolate performance on downstream vision tasks as upstream training dataset size increases. In this large-scale vision subset of the benchmark, the tasks that are evaluated are error rate on each of various few-shot downstream image classification (IC) tasks; the downstream tasks are: Birds 200 \citep{welinder2010caltech}, Caltech101 \citep{fei2004learning}, CIFAR-100 \citep{krizhevsky2009learning}, and ImageNet \citep{deng2009imagenet}. The following architectures of various sizes are pretrained on subsets of JFT-300M \citep{sun2017revisiting}: big-transfer residual neural networks (BiT) \citep{kolesnikov2020big}, MLP mixers (MiX) \citep{tolstikhin2021mlp}, and vision transformers (ViT) \citep{dosovitskiy2020image}. As can be seen in Tables  \ref{table:scaling_laws_benchmark_dataset__summary} and \ref{table:scaling_laws_benchmark_dataset__Vision}, BNSL yields extrapolations with the lowest RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error) for 69.44\% of tasks of any of the functional forms, while the next best functional form performs the best on only 13.89\% of the tasks.

In Section \ref{section:vision_tasks__compute_optimal}, we additionally show that BNSL yields accurate extrapolations of performance on large-scale downstream vision tasks when amount of compute used for (pre-)training is on the x-axis and compute is scaled in the manner that is Pareto optimal with respect to the performance evaluation metric on the y-axis (downstream accuracy in this case).

\subsection{Language}
\label{section:scaling_benchmark__language}
\vspace{-3.5mm}
Using the scaling laws benchmark of \cite{Alabdulmohsi2022revisiting}, we evaluate how well various functional forms extrapolate performance on language tasks as the (pre-)training dataset size increases. In this large-scale language subset of the benchmark, the tasks that are evaluated are error rates on each of the various downstream tasks from the BIG-Bench (BB) \citep{srivastava2022beyond} benchmark and upstream test cross-entropy of various models trained to do language modeling (LM) and neural machine translation (NMT). All LM and BB tasks use a decoder-only language model. As can be seen in Tables  \ref{table:scaling_laws_benchmark_dataset__summary} and \ref{table:scaling_laws_benchmark_dataset__language}, BNSL yields extrapolations with the lowest RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error) for 75\% of tasks of any of the functional forms, while the next best functional form performs the best on only 10\% of the tasks.

% TODO: Should these sentence be removed.
% The one task subset where the extrapolations of BNSL are comparable (rather than considerably better) is upstream cross entropy of language modeling because in that task the RMSLE is already very low (i.e. lower than 1e-3) such that there is not much headroom to improve further. Sentence about 

%\todo[inline]{TODO: Use multiple breaks to improve Big-Bench; first just try removing early points as easy ablation to know whether multiple breaks will help}

%\todo[inline]{TODO: In Figure \ref{fig:scaling_laws_benchmark_dataset__big_bench} caption, explain why the BB extrapolations are unsatisfactory (e.g. not enough seeds/breaks)}

In Section \ref{section:language_tasks__number_of_parameters} (and also Figure \ref{fig:extrapolate_oom_main_paper}), we additionally show that BNSL yields accurate extrapolations of performance (to scales that are over an order of magnitude larger than the maximum (along the x-axis) of the points used for fitting) on large-scale downstream language tasks when number of model parameters is on the x-axis.

In Section \ref{section:extrapolate_gpt4}, BNSL accurately extrapolates the scaling behavior of downstream performance to scales that are \textbf{over 100,000 times larger} than the maximum (along x-axis) of the points used for fitting (and also when amount of compute used for (pre-)training is on the x-axis and compute is scaled in the manner that is Pareto optimal with respect to the downstream performance evaluation metric on the y-axis).

%While all of their functional forms tend to underestimate loss, ours has more of a tendency to overestimate loss,

We show that BNSL accurately models and extrapolates the scaling behaviors of various multi-agent and single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms trained in various environments. In the top left plot and top middle plot and top right plot of Figure \ref{fig:rl_scaling}, BNSL accurately models and extrapolates the scaling behavior of the AlphaZero algorithm trained to play the game Connect Four from Figure 4 and Figure 5 and Figure 3 respectively of \cite{neumann2022scaling}; the x-axes respectively are compute (FLOPs) used for training, training dataset size (states), and number of model parameters. In Figure \ref{fig:rl_scaling} bottom left and bottom right respectively, BNSL accurately models and extrapolates the scaling behavior of the Phasic Policy Gradient (PPG) algorithm \citep{cobbe2021phasic} trained to play the Procgen \citep{cobbe2020leveraging} game called StarPilot and the scaling behavior of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm \citep{schulman2017proximal} trained to play the Procgen \citep{cobbe2020leveraging} game called Heist.

In Section \ref{section:ai_alignment}, we find BNSL accurately extrapolates the scaling behavior of a pretrained language model finetuned (i.e. aligned) via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to be helpful from Figure 1 of \cite{bai2022training}.

\label{section:Inflection_Points}
\vspace{-3.0mm}
We show that BNSL is capable of modeling and extrapolating the scaling behavior of tasks that have an inflection point on a linear-linear plot such as the task of arithmetic (4-digit addition). Here we model and extrapolate the scaling behavior of a transformer model (\cite{vaswani2017attention}) with respect to the training dataset size on the 4-digit addition task. Various other functional forms are mathematically incapable of expressing inflection points on a linear-linear plot (as shown in Section \ref{section:math_proofs}) and as a result, are mathematically incapable of expressing and modeling inflection points (on a linear-linear plot) that are present in the scaling behavior of 4-digit addition. In Figure \ref{fig:arithmetic} left, we show that BNSL expresses and accurately models the inflection point present in the scaling behavior of 4-digit addition and as a result accurately extrapolates the scaling behavior of 4 digit addition. For further details about the hyperparameters please refer to the Appendix Section \ref{section:Inflection_points_experimental}.

%\subsection{The Limit of the Predictability of Scaling Behavior}
\vspace{-2.0mm}
\section{The Limit of the Predictability of Scaling Behavior}
\label{section:limit_of_agi_superforecasting}
\vspace{-4.0mm}
We use BNSL to glean insights about the limit of the predictability of scaling behavior. Recent papers \citep{ganguli2022predictability, wei2022emergent} have advertised many tasks as having ``unpredictable" ``emergent" ``phase transition/change" scaling behavior, the most famous of which is the task of arithmetic. In the previous section and in Figure \ref{fig:arithmetic} left, we successfully predicted (i.e. extrapolated) the scaling behavior of 4-digit addition (arithmetic). However, we are only able to accurately extrapolate the scaling behavior if given some points from training runs with a training dataset size of at least 720, and the break in which the scaling behavior of 4-digit addition transitions from one power law to another steeper power-law happens at around training dataset size of 415. 

\vspace{-1.4mm}

Ideally, one would like to be able to extrapolate the entire scaling behavior by fitting only points from before the break. In Figure \ref{fig:arithmetic} right, we use a noiseless simulation of the BNSL of 4-digit addition to show what would happen if one had infinitely many training runs / seeds to average out all the noisy deviation between runs such that one could recover (i.e. learn via a curve-fitting library such as SciPy \citep{virtanen2020scipy}) the learned constants of the BNSL as well as possible. When using this noiseless simulation, we find that we are only able to accurately extrapolate the scaling behavior if given some points from training runs with a training dataset size of at least 415, which is very close to the break. 

%\vspace{-0.4mm}

%This implies that very near to the break there is limit as to how small the maximum of the x-axis of the points used for fitting can be if one wants to perfectly extrapolate the scaling behavior, even if one has infinitely many seeds / training runs. 


%\todo[inline]{TODO: replace maximum with maximum but the wording has to be more clear if maximum is used}

This has a few implications:

\vspace{-1.8mm}

1) When the scaling behavior exhibits greater than 0 breaks that are sufficiently sharp, there is a limit as to how small the maximum (along the x-axis) of the points used for fitting can be if one wants to perfectly extrapolate the scaling behavior, even if one has infinitely many seeds / training runs.

\vspace{-1.8mm}

2) If an additional break of sufficient sharpness happens at a scale that is sufficiently larger than the maximum (along the x-axis) of the points used for fitting, there does not (currently) exist a way to extrapolate the scaling behavior after that additional break.

\vspace{-1.8mm}

3) If a break of sufficient sharpness happens at a scale sufficiently smaller than the maximum (along the x-axis) of the points used for fitting, points smaller (along the x-axis) than that break are often useless for improving extrapolation.

%TODO: Mention it is a one break-point simulation. Mention how the simulation is done.

%\section{Conclusions}
\section{Discussion}
%\vspace{-4.8mm}
%\noindent{\bf Summary.}
We have presented a smoothly broken power law functional form that accurately models and extrapolates the scaling behaviors of artificial neural networks for various architectures and for each of various tasks from a very large and diverse set of upstream and downstream tasks. This set includes large-scale vision, language, audio, video, diffusion, generative modeling, multimodal learning, contrastive learning, AI alignment, robotics, out-of-distribution generalization, continual learning, transfer learning, uncertainty estimation / calibration, out-of-distribution detection, adversarial robustness, distillation, sparsity, retrieval, quantization, pruning, fairness, molecules, computer programming/coding, math word problems, ``emergent" ``phase transitions", arithmetic, unsupervised/self-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning (single agent and multi-agent). When compared to other functional forms for neural scaling behavior, this functional form yields extrapolations of scaling behavior that are considerably more accurate on this set. Additionally, this functional form accurately models and extrapolates scaling behavior that other functional forms are incapable of expressing such as the non-monotonic transitions present in the scaling behavior of phenomena such as double descent and the delayed, sharp inflection points present in the scaling behavior of tasks such as arithmetic. Lastly, we used this functional form to glean insights about the limit of the predictability of scaling behavior.

%\noindent{\bf Future Work.} We place relatively high probability on the claim that variants of smoothly broken power laws (e.g. BNSL) perhaps are the ``true" functional form of the scaling behavior of all(?) things that involve artificial neural networks and encourage the community to work on disproving or further verifying this claim.

%\noindent{\bf Limitations.} A limitation of the current approach is the potential need to collect enough samples of the system's performance (i.e. the (x,y) points required for estimating the scaling laws parameters). A small number of samples may not be sufficient to accurately fit and extrapolate the BNSL functional form, and obtaining a large number of such samples can sometimes be costly.
%\noindent{\bf Limitations.} Among the most significant limitations of the current approach is the potential need for an effective algorithm that allows to collect enough samples of system's performance (i.e. the (x,y) points required for estimating the scaling laws parameters). A small number of samples may not be sufficient to accurately fit and extrapolate the BNSL functional form, but obtaining a large number of such samples can sometimes be costly. %Thus, we need to develop an algorithm for finding cost-efficient sampling trade-off. This is one of the immediate next steps in our future work plans.

\subsubsection*{Ethics Statement}
We place relatively high probability on the claim that variants of smoothly broken power laws perhaps are the ``true" functional form of the scaling behavior of many (all?) things that involve artificial neural networks. Due to the fact that BNSL is a variant of smoothly broken power laws, an ethical concern one might have about our work is that revealing BNSL might differentially \citep{hendrycks2022x} improve A(G)I capabilities progress relative to A(G)I safety/alignment progress. 
A counter-argument is that BNSL will also allow the A(G)I safety/alignment field to extrapolate the scaling behaviors of its methods for aligning A(G)I systems and as a result will also accelerate alignment/safety progress.
Existing scaling laws besides BNSL struggle especially to model downstream performance, e.g.\ on safety-relevant evaluations (especially evaluations (such as interpretability and controllability) that might exhibit non-monotonic scaling behavior in the larger scale systems of the future); we believe our work could differentially help in forecasting emergence of novel capabilities (such as reasoning \citep{wei2022chain}) or behaviors (such as deception or dishonesty \citep{evans2021truthful,lin2021truthfulqa}), and thus help avoid unpleasant surprises.

A potential limitation of the current approach is the need to collect enough samples of the system’s performance (i.e. the (x,y) points required for estimating the scaling laws parameters). A small number of samples sometimes may not be sufficient to accurately fit and extrapolate the BNSL functional form, and obtaining a large number of such samples can sometimes be costly. This has the ethical implication that entities with more compute to gather more points maybe will have considerably more accurate extrapolations of scaling behavior than entities with less compute. As a result, entities with less compute (e.g. academia) maybe will have less foresight than entities with more compute (e.g. Big Tech), which could maybe exacerbate the gap between entities with more compute (e.g. Big Tech) and entities with less compute (e.g. academia).

\subsection{Analysis and Explanation of why BNSL is smoothly connected piecewise (approximately) linear function on a log-log plot}
\label{section:bnsl_analysis}

Analysing Equation ~\ref{eq:BNSL} reveals why BNSL is smoothly connected piecewise (approximately) linear function on a log-log plot. % this is the case.
Considering $y$ as a function of $z:=\log(x)$, applying logarithms to both sides and setting $a=0$ yields:
\begin{equation}
\log (y) =  \log (b) - c_0 z -  \sum_{i=1}^n c_i f_i \log\left(1 + \left(\frac{\exp(z)}{d_i}\right)^{1/f_i}\right).
%\label{eq:BNSL}
\end{equation}
We can now see the terms in the sum resemble the well-known $\mathrm{softplus}$ function: $\mathrm{softplus}(x) := \log(1 + exp(x))$, which smoothly interpolates between the constant 0 function and the identity.
By plotting one such term for different values of $c_i, d_i, f_i$, it is easy to confirm that they influence the shape of the curve as described in Section \ref{section:bnsl}.

\subsection{Decomposition of Broken Neural Scaling Law into power law segments that it is composed of}
\label{section:decomposition_of_BNSL}

We now show a way to decompose a BNSL (Equation \ref{eq:BNSL}) with 3 breaks into the power law segments that it is composed of. This decomposition is what we used to produce power law segments 1-4 overlaid in Figure \ref{fig:figure_1} and is usable when values of $f$ in Equation \ref{eq:BNSL} are not too large. This decomposition pattern is straight-forward to extend to $n$ breaks.

$segment_1 = b * (x)^{-(c_0)}$

$segment_2 = b * (d_1)^{-(c_0)} * (x\hspace{.14cm}/d_1)^{-(c_1+c_0)}$

$segment_3 = b * (d_1)^{-(c_0)} * (d_2/d_1)^{-(c_1+c_0)} * (x\hspace{.14cm}/d_2)^{-(c_2+c_1+c_0)}$

$segment_4 = b * (d_1)^{-(c_0)} * (d_2/d_1)^{-(c_1+c_0)} * (d_3/d_2)^{-(c_2+c_1+c_0)} * (x\hspace{.14cm}/d_3)^{-(c_3+c_2+c_1+c_0)}$

\subsection{Experimental details of Section \ref{section:Inflection_Points}}
\label{section:Inflection_points_experimental}
We perform an extensive set of experiments to model and extrapolate the scaling behavior for the 4-digit arithmetic addition task with respect to the training dataset size. Our code is based on the minGPT implementation \citep{Karpathy2020}. We set the batch size equal to the training dataset size. We do not use dropout nor a learning rate decay / schedule / warmup here. Each experiment was run on a single V100 GPU and each run took less than 2 hours. For our experiments we train the transformer model using the following set of hyperparameters:

\subsection{Experimental details of fitting BNSL and determining the number of breaks}
\label{section:BNSL_fit_details}
We fit BNSL as follows:
We first use scipy.optimize.brute to do a grid search of the values of the constants ($a, b, c_0, c_1 ... c_n, d_1 ...  d_n, f_1 ... f_n$) of BNSL that best minimize the mean squared log error (MSLE) between the real data and the output of BNSL.
We then use the values obtained from the grid search as the initialization of the non-linear least squares algorithm of scipy.optimize.curve\_fit.
We then use the non-linear least squares algorithm of scipy.optimize.curve\_fit to minimize the mean squared log error (MSLE) between the real data and the output of BNSL.

The version of MSLE we use for such optimization is the following numerically stable variant:

\[Numerically\_Stable\_MSLE = \sum_{i=1}^{N} ((log(y_{i}+1)-log(\hat{y}_{i}+1))^2)/N\] 

With regards to determining the number of breaks $n$ in the BNSL, one way to go about doing so is to hold out the last few largest (along the x-axis) points used for fitting (not the green points used for evaluating extrapolation) as a validation set. The value of $n$ with lowest validation error when fitting on the remaining smaller (along the x-axis) points is then used. As mentioned in \textbf{implication 3 of Section \ref{section:limit_of_agi_superforecasting}}, there are many scenarios in which a break of sufficient sharpness happens at a scale sufficiently smaller than the maximum (along the x-axis) of the points used for fitting such that points smaller (along the x-axis) than that break are often useless for improving extrapolation. For example, if a full scaling behavior contains a very sharp break and then a very smooth break, one can \textbf{crop} out the smaller (along the x-axis) points that contain the sharp break and fit a BNSL with a single break (i.e. with $n=1$) if one only cares about extrapolation accuracy. To determine where the crop point is, one can employ the same validation set strategy mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph, but selecting for crop point instead of number of breaks.

\subsection{Multivariate BNSL}
\label{section:BNSL_multivariate}

Using equation \ref{eq:BNSL_multivariate}, one can extend BNSL to multivariate settings in which one wants to know how the evaluation metric of interest varies as multiple dimensions simultaneously vary. For example, if one simultaneously varies number of model parameters and training dataset size, one sets $m$ in equation \ref{eq:BNSL_multivariate} to 2, and the 2 (i.e. $m$) dimensions refer to number of model parameters as the first dimension and training dataset size as the second dimension.

\begin{equation}
\vspace{-0.05in}
y =  a + \sum_{j=1}^{m}\Bigg(\bigg(b_j{x_j}^{{{c_0}_{}}_j}\bigg) \prod_{i=1}^{n_j} \left(1 + \left(\frac{x_j}{{{d_i}_{}}_j}\right)^{{1/{{f_i}_{}}}_j}\right)^{-{{c_i}_{}}_j * {{f_i}_{}}_j}\Bigg)

In Figure \ref{fig:vision_compute_scaling} via fitting BNSL, we additionally obtain accurate extrapolations of the scaling behavior of large-scale downstream vision tasks when compute (FLOPs) used for (pre-)training is on the x-axis and compute is scaled in the manner that is Pareto optimal with respect to the performance evaluation metric (downstream accuracy in this case). The y-axis is downstream test error rate on ImageNet. The upstream task is supervised pretraining of ViT \citep{dosovitskiy2020image} models on subsets of JFT-300M \citep{sun2017revisiting}. The experimental scaling data was obtained from Figure 2 of \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2106-04560}, and as a result in Table \ref{table:vision_compute_scaling} we compare extrapolation of BNSL to the extrapolation of M3 (which was proposed in \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2106-04560}); we find that BNSL yields extrapolations of scaling behavior that are more accurate on these tasks.

For many other downstream tasks with number of model parameters on the x-axis, the variance between seeds is much higher such that a number considerably larger than 11 points along the curve is needed to obtain an accurate extrapolation.

    BIG-Bench (BB). From eyeballing, we think the subset of BIG-Bench with unsatisfactory extrapolations has unsatisfactory extrapolations due to the maximum (along the x-axis) of the black point used for fitting being near or before a break; this is accentuated by not having enough points for fitting for the SciPy fitter to be able to determine whether the break is an actual break or just noisy deviation. See Section \ref{section:limit_of_agi_superforecasting} for more details on this explanation.
