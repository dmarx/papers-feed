We propose Apollo, a novel method specifically designed for compressed audio restoration. Apollo significantly enhances audio quality in the frequency domain through band split, sequence modeling, and reconstruction modules. Empirical evaluations on the integrated MUSDB18-HQ and MoisesDB datasets validate Apollo's outstanding performance. Notably, Apollo achieves substantial improvements in music restoration while maintaining a smaller model size and high computational efficiency. The experimental results demonstrated that when addressing the complex acoustic characteristics of music, band-split, and band-sequence modeling more effectively captured and restored audio information lost during compression.
