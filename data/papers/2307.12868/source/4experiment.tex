\subsection{Image editing with the latent basis}
% \subsection{\jo{latent-based editing with and without prompts}}
\label{sec:local}
% \yh{TODO : local figure 완성되고 나서 작성}

% In \sref{sec:sec3}, we introduce a method for determining local latent basis utilizing the pullback metric. 
In this subsection, we demonstrate the capability of our discovered latent basis for image editing. 
To extract the latent variables from real images for editing purposes, we use DDIM inversion.
In experiments with Stable Diffusion (SD), we do not use guidance, i.e., unconditional sampling, for both DDIM inversion and DDIM sampling processes.
This ensures that our editing results solely depend on the latent variable, not on other factors such as prompt conditions.
% This ensures that our editing result is solely the outcome of manipulating the latent variable.
% Consequently, we only utilize the text guide to extract the local latent structure and keep the generative process as unconditional sampling to minimize the influence of text.
% It is worth to note that we only use the text condition when we extract the local latent structure
% when given a text (refer to \fref{fig:text}). 

% \modify{add text conditional basis; cross attention이 특정 feature를 강조할텐데 그걸 pc를 구해도 다 텍스트에 관련된 basis만 나오는 것을 기대해야 하고, 우리가 관측한것도 이런 기대에 부합한다. text cond 피규어는 여러 local basis중에 하나 고른거고 나머지는 appendix봐라.}

Figures~\ref{fig:method} and \ref{fig:local_basis} illustrate the example results edited by the latent basis found by our method.
% demonstrate the discovery of diverse basis across different datasets which highlights the superiority of our approach \emph{without supervision} such as CLIP or a classifier. 
The latent basis clearly contains semantics such as age, gender, species, structure, and texture. 
% When modulating the strength of the basis, the resulting image undergoes continuous changes, as exemplified in \fref{fig:local_basis}. 
{Note that editing at timestep $T$ yields coarse changes such as age and species. On the other hand, editing at timestep $0.6T$ leads to fine changes, such as nose color and facial expression.} 
% Appendix provides more examples.
% In the subsequent section, we delve into a detailed analysis of the latent basis from these distinct timesteps.

% Significantly, editing at timestep $T$ results in coarse changes, whereas editing at timestep $0.6T$ produces finer changes, as exemplified by various examples. 
% In the following section, we will thoroughly explore and analyze the local semantic foundation derived from these distinct timesteps.

\fref{fig:local_basis_text_vk} demonstrates the example results edited by the various latent basis vectors.
Interestingly, using the text ``lion'' as a condition, 
the entire latent basis {captures lion-related attributes.} % aligns with the text.
% Moreover, \fref{fig:local_basis_text} shows that the latent basis can be aligned with the text not only for the type of object but also the action.
Furthermore, \fref{fig:local_basis_text} shows that the latent basis aligns with the text not only in terms of object types but also in relation to pose or action.
\modify{For a qualitative comparison with other state-of-the-art image editing methods, refer to 
\aref{appendix:comparisons}. For more examples of editing results, refer to \aref{appendix:additional_results}.}

% \fref{fig:local_basis_text_vk} demonstrates the impact on the basis of the tangent space when considering a given text. 
% One can expect the obtained basis from \ehspace{} becomes influenced by the text condition. 
% Consequently, anticipations align with our observations. 
% \modify{In the case of unconditional conditions}, the basis exhibits distinct characteristics. However, upon using the text ``lion" as a condition, noticeable lion-related modifications can be observed across all basis. This phenomenon enables editing within the semantic subspace that corresponds to the intended text, as depicted in \fref{fig:local_basis_text}. 
% We selected one of the bases, yet each basis consistently yielded results associated with the given text. It is intriguing that the capability for editing extends even to actions, such as running, even though we just added the basis only one time. Please refer to the appendix for other bases.
% In this subsection, we demonstrate our discovered latent basis through real image editing. 
% By adding the latent basis vector by utilizing the x-space guidance, we were able to apply semantic manipulations to the image.
% In Stable Diffusion, the latent basis manipulates the image in a way that is semantically aligned with the given prompt.

% Interestingly, editing at timestep $T$ leads to coarse changes such as hair color, hair length, far breed.

% \paragraph{Stable Diffusion} 
% This section demonstrates that our method is generalized to Stable Diffusion \cite{rombach2022high}. Our method extracts latent directions in the learned latent space $\vz_t$ using the same procedure. \fref{fig:ldm} (a) shows the edited images along different directions on various timesteps. 
% The phenomena are similar to the image-based DMs:

% Furthermore, \fref{fig:ldm} (b) shows that a global semantic direction leads to the same \textit{zoom-out} effect on different samples. Contrary to the global directions in the image-based DMs, the global directions are found within a text prompt, i.e., each text prompt has its own global directions. \aref{appendix:additional_results} provides more examples where we find some odd cases indicating that the learned latent space may not follow the same assumptions of the image-based DMs or the text guidance somehow twists the manifold.

%\paragraph{latent basis evolves from low frequencies to high frequencies.}
% \paragraph{The frequency domain of latent basis evolves from low-to-high.}
\label{sec:evolution-x}



% In \sref{sec:local}, we observed that coarse manipulations are performed at the beginning of the denoising step, and then finer manipulations are performed as the timestep progresses. 
% To quantitatively verify this observation, we plotted the power spectral density (PSD) of the discovered latent basis. 

\fref{figure:PSD} is the power spectral density (PSD) of the discovered {latent} basis over various timesteps. 
The early timesteps contain a larger portion of low frequency than the later timesteps and the later timesteps contain a larger portion of high frequency.

This suggests that the model focuses on low-frequency signals at the beginning of the generative process and then shifts its {focus} to high-frequency signals over time.
This result strengthens the common understanding
about the coarse-to-fine behavior of DMs over the generative process \cite{choi2022perception, daras2022multiresolution}.

% In the forward diffusion process, high-frequency details are perturbed faster than low-frequency signals.

\fref{fig:homo} demonstrates that the tangent space\uh{s} of the different samples are the most similar at $t=T$ and diverge as {timestep becomes} zero. 
% This aligns with the existing understanding that, after a certain timestep, the reverse diffusion trajectories of different samples are isolated from each other\cite{zhang2022gddim, wu2022uncovering}.


Moreover, the similarity across tangent space{s} allows us to effectively transfer the latent basis from one {sample} to another through parallel transport as shown in \fref{fig:parallel}.

{On the other hand, parallel transport at $t=0.6T$ does not lead to satisfactory editing because the tangent spaces are hardly homogeneous. Thus, we should examine the similarity of local subspaces to ensure consistent editing across samples.}
% However, when attempting parallel transport at $t=0.6T$, where homogeneity is lacking, it fails to produce satisfactory outcomes.
% This underscores the significance of considering the similarity of local subspaces.



% This is corroborated by the results depicted in \fref{fig:parallel}.

% In the previous section, we studied the evolution of the tangent space by comparing different samples. This time, we investigate how the tangent space change by comparing it across different timesteps.

% This suggests that the local latent basis that the model pays attention to at each point in time is similar. To help readers understand this, we illustrate in Figure 1b how much of the original feature captured by vector vi is lost when we transport it from one timestep to another, using parallel transport from t = T to 0.1T. As expected, when the local tangent space is similar, the transported vector maintains its existing signal, but it loses this pattern as we move further away from the original timestep. We found this relationship between local tangent space and local semantic subspace to hold true for all datasets. For a more detailed discussion, please refer to the appendix.

In \fref{fig:timestep} (a), we provide a distance matrix of the tangent spaces across different timesteps, measured by the geodesic metric. 
We observe that the tangent spaces are more similar to each other when a model is trained on CelebA-HQ, compared to ImageNet.
\uh{To verify this trend, we measure the geodesic distances between tangent spaces of different timesteps and plot the average distances of the same difference in timestep in \fref{fig:timestep} (b)}.
% To verify this trend, in \fref{fig:timestep} (c), we measured the average geodesic distance of the tangent space according to the difference of diffusion timesteps.
As expected, we find that DMs trained on datasets, that are generally considered simpler, have similar local tangent spaces over time.

% We further investigate the coarse-to-fine editing along the generative process from timestep $T$ to $0$. \fref{fig:PSD} (a) shows the example directions $\vv_i$ across different timesteps. At $T$, $\vv_i$ leads to coarse attribute changes in $\vx_0$ by blurry change in $\vx_T$. At $0.25T$, $\vv_i$ edits high-frequency details in both $\vx_0$ and $\vx_t$. \fref{fig:PSD} (b) shows the power spectral density (PSD) of $\vv_i$. We compute the PSD by taking $\vv_1, ..., \vv_{10}$ from 20 samples. The early timesteps contain a larger portion of low frequency than the later timesteps and the later timesteps contain a larger portion of high frequency. This phenomenon agrees with the tendency in the edited images. This results strengthens the common understanding of the timesteps~\cite{kwon2022diffusion,choi2022perception, daras2022multiresolution}.

% \fref{fig:stable_text} (c) provides the geodesic distance in the tangent space between all texts and the geodesic distance in the semantic subspace between all texts. 
Notably, as the diffusion timestep approaches values below $0.7T$, the distances between the local tangent spaces start to decrease. 
It implies that the variation due to walking along the local tangent basis depends less on the text conditions, i.e., the text less influences the generative process, in later timesteps.
% This signifies that with smaller timesteps, the variation in the local tangent space becomes less dependent on the text, implying a reduced influence of the text.

% Furthermore, we also discover that the geodesic distance in the semantic subspace is maximized at $0.7T$. This observation highlights the disparity in the basis at $0.7T$, thus implying why performing edits at around $0.7T$ is well.

% \subsection{Curved manifold of DMs} % \subsection{Indepth analysis on the latent space of DMs} 
% \label{sec:slerp}
% We present empirical grounds for the assumption in \sref{sec:method_local}: $\mathcal{X}$ is a curved manifold. Semantic path length between two points on a manifold is defined by the sum of the local warpage of the line segments which connects them along the manifold. We use \emph{geodesic metric}~\cite{choi2021not, ye2016schubert} to define the curvedness of a line segment $\{\vx^{(1)}, \vx^{(2)}\}$ as the angle between two tangent spaces centered at $\{\vh^{(1)}, \vh^{(2)}\}$: 
% \begin{equation}
% D_{\text{geo}}(\mathcal{T}_{\vh^{(1)}}, \mathcal{T}_{\vh^{(2)}}) = \sqrt{\sum_k \theta_k^2},
% \end{equation}
% where $\theta_k = \cos^{-1}(\sigma_k)$ denotes the $k$-th principle angle between $\mathcal{T}_{\vh^{(1)}}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{\vh^{(2)}}$.
% The angle is visualized in \fref{fig:slerp_lerp} (b). Then, the semantic path length becomes $\sum_l D_\text{geo}(\mathcal{T}_{\vh^{(l)}}, \mathcal{T}_{\vh^{(l+1)}})$, where $l$ denotes the segment index in the path. We set the number of segments to $30$.
% Then, the semantic path length increases as the path deviates further from the manifold.



% To verify the assumption, we compare the semantic path lengths of different paths, e.g., linear path, spherical path, and geodesic shooting path. 
% \fref{fig:slerp_lerp} (a) visualizes the manifold, linear path (lerp), and spherical path (slerp) and their corresponding path on $\mathcal{H}$ mapped by the function $f$. We computed the semantic path lengths for 50 randomly selected pairs of images. \tref{tab:semantic_path_length} shows that the semantic path length of slerp is smaller than lerp, indicating that the slerp path lies closer to the manifold than lerp, i.e., the manifold is curved. \fref{fig:slerp_lerp} (b) shows the distribution of the length of the segments along the path. Interestingly, the length of the lerp is high at the ends and shrinks to that of geodesics near the center. We suppose that the lerp path moves away from the original manifold and moves along another manifold.


% Our semantic path length resembles the perceptual path length (PPL, \citet{karras2019style}) regarding the summation along the interpolation path.
% PPL measures LPIPS \cite{zhang2018unreasonable} distance between resulting images along the path. Higher PPL between two latent variables indicates spikier interpolation of images accompanying artifacts. On the other hand, semantic path length measures how drastically the geometric structure changes between neighboring tangent spaces.

% As we introduce the first unsupervised editing in DMs, we compare our method with GANSpace \cite{harkonen2020ganspace} considering the mapping from $\mathcal{X}$ to $\mathcal{H}$ instead of $\mathcal{Z}$ to $\mathcal{W}$ in GANs. Accordingly, we find directions in $\mathcal{H}$ using PCA. \fref{fig:ganspace} shows their effects: they somewhat alter the attributes but accompany severe distortion or entanglement. On the contrary, our method finds the directions with the largest changes in $\mathcal{H}$ considering the geometrical structure leading to decent manipulation as shown in earlier results. \aref{appendixsec:comparison} describes more details for GANSpace.
