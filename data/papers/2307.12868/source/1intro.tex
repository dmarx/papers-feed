\section{Introduction}
The diffusion models (DMs) are powerful generative models that have demonstrated impressive performance \cite{ho2020denoising, song2020denoising, song2020score, dhariwal2021diffusion, nichol2021improved}. 
DMs have shown remarkable applications, including text-to-image synthesis \cite{ramesh2022hierarchical, rombach2022high, balaji2022ediffi, nichol2021glide}, inverse problems \cite{chung2022improving, lugmayr2022repaint}, and image editing \cite{hertz2022prompt, tumanyan2022plug, parmar2023zero, mokady2022null}.

% Diffusion models (DMs) are highly powerful generative models that have shown great performance \cite{ho2020denoising,song2020denoising,song2020score,dhariwal2021diffusion,nichol2021improved}.
% \yh{Instead of understanding the semantic structure of latent space itself,} 
% To control the generative process,
% existing methods have introduced conditional DMs, especially for text-to-image synthesis \cite{ramesh2022hierarchical,rombach2022high,balaji2022ediffi,nichol2021glide}, or mixing the latent variables $\vx_t$ of different sampling processes \cite{choi2021ilvr,meng2021sdedit,avrahami2022blended,liew2022magicmix,kawar2022imagic,avrahami2022spatext}.

Despite their achievements, the research community lacks a comprehensive understanding of the latent space of DMs and its influence on the generated results. So far, the completely diffused images are considered as latent variables but it does not have useful properties for controlling the results. For example, traversing along a direction from a latent produces weird changes in the results.
Fortunately, \citet{kwon2022diffusion} consider the intermediate feature space of the diffusion kernel, referred to as \ehspace{}, as a semantic latent space and show its usefulness on controlling generated images. In the similar sense, some works investigate the feature maps of the self-attention or cross-attention operations for controlling the results \cite{hertz2022prompt, tumanyan2022plug, parmar2023zero}, improving sample quality \cite{chefer2023attend}, or downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation \cite{ma2023diffusionseg, xu2023open}.
% They pair this with an asymmetric sampling process and
% They demonstrated that \ehspace{} possesses a linear semantic structure.
% Following the work of \citet{kwon2022diffusion}, there have been several analyses of the DM's feature space. These investigations explore the attention map and cross-attention map, which have been used for image editing \cite{hertz2022prompt, tumanyan2022plug, parmar2023zero} or improving sample quality \cite{chefer2023attend}. Moreover, these findings can be applied to downstream tasks such as segmentation using the feature space \cite{ma2023diffusionseg, xu2023open}.

% However, they rely solely on a proxy, $\mathbf{h}$, and do not directly deal with the latent variables $\vx_t$. 
% Furthermore, due to Kwon et al.'s modification of the internal feature of UNet, particularly where skip connections exist, there is no guarantee that significant changes will result in output quality. It is worth noting that the latent space \exspace{} is a sparse manifold, which makes meaningful editing within it challenging. Nevertheless, since \ehspace{} is clearly the codomain of \exspace{}, and given the fact that a meaningful semantic direction can be found in \ehspace{}, we can also define a semantic subspace in \exspace{}.

Still, the structure of the space $\mathcal{X}_t$ where latent variables $\{\vx_t\}$ live remains unexplored despite its crucial role in understanding DMs. It is especially challenging because 1) the model is trained to estimate the forward noise which does not depend on the input, as opposed to other typical supervisions such as classification or similarity, and 2) there are lots of latent variables over multiple recursive timesteps.
% Although the feature space has been thoroughly explored, the latent space $\vx{}_t \in \mathcal{X}$ remains unexplored despite its crucial role in understanding DMs.
% This is due to the fact that the latent variable of DM, $\vx{}_t$, consists primarily of noised images.
% Therefore, it is not reasonable to expect any significant semantic structure in the latent space \exspace{}.
% \yh{Another reason is the the characteristic iterative process of the DMs which involves a sequence of noisy images and subtle noises, i.e., the embeddings are not directly connected to the final images.}
In this paper, we aim to analyze \exspace{} in conjunction with its corresponding representation \ehspace{}, by incorporating a local geometry to \exspace{} using the concept of a {\it pullback metric} in Riemannian geometry.

First, we discover the local latent basis for \exspace{} and the corresponding local tangent basis for \ehspace{}.
The local basis is obtained by performing singular value decomposition (SVD) of the Jacobian of the mapping from \exspace{} to \ehspace{}.
To validate the discovered local latent basis, we demonstrate that 
walking along the basis
% \yh{traversal along the basis} 
can edit real images in a semantically meaningful way. 
Furthermore, we can use the discovered local latent basis vector to edit other samples by using parallel transport, when they exhibit comparable local geometric structures.
Note that existing editing methods manipulate the self-attention map or cross-attention map over multiple timesteps \cite{hertz2022prompt, tumanyan2022plug, parmar2023zero}. On the other hand, we manipulate only $\vx_t$ once at a specific timestep.

Second, we investigate how the latent structures differ across different timesteps and samples as follows.
% Second, we investigate how the semantic structure changes over time and \jo{between samples}. %identified two trends.
The frequency domain of the local latent basis shifts from low-frequency to high-frequency along the generative process. 
% Although this was observed indirectly in a previous study by \citet{choi2022perception},
We explicitly confirm it using power spectral density analysis.
The difference between local tangent spaces of different samples becomes larger along the generative process. 
The local tangent spaces at various diffusion timesteps are similar to each other if the model is trained on aligned datasets such as CelebA-HQ or Flowers. However, this homogeneity does not occur on complex datasets such as ImageNet.

% We compared the evolution of the local tangent basis over time and identified groups of timesteps exhibiting with similar semantic structures. 
% Within each group, DMs processed similar basis, even when given different timesteps.

Finally, we examine how the prompts affect the latent structure of text-to-image DMs as follows.
Similar prompts yield similar latent structures. Specifically, we find a positive correlation between the similarity of prompts and the similarity of local tangent spaces.
The influence of text on the local tangent space becomes weaker along the generative process. %, specifically when the diffusion timestep is $t<0.7T$. $T$ is the maximum length of a diffusion process.

% In the experiments, we demonstrate that the directions found in an unsupervised manner indeed lead to semantic changes in the images. 
% We note that discovering the editing directions in the latent variables of diffusion models has not been tackled.
