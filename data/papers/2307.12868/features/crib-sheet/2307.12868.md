- **Diffusion Models (DMs)**: Powerful generative models for tasks like text-to-image synthesis and image editing.
  
- **Latent Space Exploration**: The latent space \( x_t \in X \) of DMs is crucial for understanding generated results but remains largely unexplored.

- **Pullback Metric**: Utilizes a pullback metric from the Euclidean space of the bottleneck layer \( H \) of the U-Net to define distances in the latent space \( X \).

- **Local Latent Basis**: Discovered through singular value decomposition (SVD) of the Jacobian \( J_x \) mapping from \( X \) to \( H \). The local latent basis is defined as:
  \[
  T_x \equiv \text{span}\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}
  \]
  where \( v_i \) are the right singular vectors of \( J_x \).

- **Image Editing via x-space Traversal**: The method allows for image editing by manipulating \( x_t \) along the local latent basis at a specific timestep \( t \) without additional training. The editing is defined as:
  \[
  x_{XG} = x + \gamma[\epsilon_\theta(x + v) - \epsilon_\theta(x)]
  \]
  where \( \gamma \) is a hyperparameter controlling editing strength.

- **Geometric Structure Evolution**: The latent structure evolves from low-frequency to high-frequency along the generative process, confirmed through power spectral density analysis.

- **Influence of Text Prompts**: Similar prompts yield similar latent structures, with a positive correlation between prompt similarity and local tangent space similarity. The influence weakens over the generative process.

- **Parallel Transport for Editing**: Allows the application of the discovered local latent basis to other samples with comparable geometric structures, facilitating semantic editing across different images.

- **Key Findings**: 
  - The local tangent spaces differ across datasets, showing homogeneity in simpler datasets (e.g., CelebA-HQ) and variability in complex datasets (e.g., ImageNet).
  - The method provides a novel approach to image editing in DMs, enhancing the understanding of their latent space and its geometric properties.
