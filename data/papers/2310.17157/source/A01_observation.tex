\section{Additional Observation on Slowly Changing Observation}
\label{sec:appendix-obs}

First, we present more plots on the cosine similarity between representations. Figure~\ref{appendix:observation_changing} plots the cosine similarity between activation across layers on OPT family. It is evident that similarity is high for the larger models.

There are two residual connections inside a transformer layer, one around the attention block, and the other one around the MLP block. The residual connection can be written as $X + F(X)$, where $F$ is either the Multi-Head Attention or two MLP Layer. Figure~\ref{appendix:residual} plots the cosine similarity between $X$ and $X + F(X)$, which is close to 1.0, and the cosine similarity between $X$ and $F(X)$, which is close to 0.0. This happens because $\|X\|$ is significantly greater than $\|F(X)\|$, shown in the purple. In the first layer, $\|F(X)\|$ is larger, which explains the low cosine similarity. The magnitude of the $L2$ norm is different across models, however, we observe a similar trend with models of different sizes. There exists a normalization layer before $F(X)$ and the layer normalization scale $\|X\|$ to a consistent magnitude across layers (e.g. 85 for OPT-30B, 110 for OPT175B), but not necessarily scale down $\|X\|$.
