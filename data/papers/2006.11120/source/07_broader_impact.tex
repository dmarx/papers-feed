\section*{Broader Impact}
% This work does not present any foreseeable societal consequence.

% The dynamic features of the new CC-layer has the potential to replace multiple network (for example SR networks for different scales) with a single network, which may yield both better results and may save resources (especially electricity).

\textbf{\it Authors are required to include a statement of the broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. 
Authors should discuss both positive and negative outcomes, if any.} \\

\underline{\textbf{AUTHORS' ANSWER:}}

\textbf{a) Who may benefit from this research?}
Any ML or CV researcher, or code developer, who uses Deep Learning code and designs neural architectures.

\textbf{b) Who may be put at disadvantage from this research?}
No one, to our best knowledge.

\textbf{c) What are the consequences of failure of the system?}
Not applicable. This is not a system, but rather a new useful component in Deep Learning architectures.

\textbf{d) Whether the task/method leverages biases in the data?}
Not to our best knowledge.
