        "authors": "Lisa Schut, Nenad Tomasev, Tom McGrath, Demis Hassabis, Ulrich Paquet, Been Kim",
        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have made remarkable progress, attaining\nsuper-human performance across various domains. This presents us with an\nopportunity to further human knowledge and improve human expert performance by\nleveraging the hidden knowledge encoded within these highly performant AI\nsystems. Yet, this knowledge is often hard to extract, and may be hard to\nunderstand or learn from. Here, we show that this is possible by proposing a\nnew method that allows us to extract new chess concepts in AlphaZero, an AI\nsystem that mastered the game of chess via self-play without human supervision.\nOur analysis indicates that AlphaZero may encode knowledge that extends beyond\nthe existing human knowledge, but knowledge that is ultimately not beyond human\ngrasp, and can be successfully learned from. In a human study, we show that\nthese concepts are learnable by top human experts, as four top chess\ngrandmasters show improvements in solving the presented concept prototype\npositions. This marks an important first milestone in advancing the frontier of\nhuman knowledge by leveraging AI; a development that could bear profound\nimplications and help us shape how we interact with AI systems across many AI\napplications.",

        "title": "Grokking at the Edge of Numerical Stability",
        "authors": "Lucas Prieto, Melih Barsbey, Pedro A. M. Mediano, Tolga Birdal",
        "abstract": "Grokking, the sudden generalization that occurs after prolonged overfitting,\nis a surprising phenomenon challenging our understanding of deep learning.\nAlthough significant progress has been made in understanding grokking, the\nreasons behind the delayed generalization and its dependence on regularization\nremain unclear. In this work, we argue that without regularization, grokking\ntasks push models to the edge of numerical stability, introducing floating\npoint errors in the Softmax function, which we refer to as Softmax Collapse\n(SC). We demonstrate that SC prevents grokking and that mitigating SC enables\ngrokking without regularization. Investigating the root cause of SC, we find\nthat beyond the point of overfitting, the gradients strongly align with what we\ncall the na\\\"ive loss minimization (NLM) direction. This component of the\ngradient does not alter the model's predictions but decreases the loss by\nscaling the logits, typically by scaling the weights along their current\ndirection. We show that this scaling of the logits explains the delay in\ngeneralization characteristic of grokking and eventually leads to SC, halting\nfurther learning. To validate our hypotheses, we introduce two key\ncontributions that address the challenges in grokking tasks: StableMax, a new\nactivation function that prevents SC and enables grokking without\nregularization, and $\\perp$Grad, a training algorithm that promotes quick\ngeneralization in grokking tasks by preventing NLM altogether. These\ncontributions provide new insights into grokking, elucidating its delayed\ngeneralization, reliance on regularization, and the effectiveness of existing\ngrokking-inducing methods.

        "abstract": "Modern data acquisition routinely produce massive amounts of event sequence\ndata in various domains, such as social media, healthcare, and financial\nmarkets. These data often exhibit complicated short-term and long-term temporal\ndependencies. However, most of the existing recurrent neural network based\npoint process models fail to capture such dependencies, and yield unreliable\nprediction performance. To address this issue, we propose a Transformer Hawkes\nProcess (THP) model, which leverages the self-attention mechanism to capture\nlong-term dependencies and meanwhile enjoys computational efficiency. Numerical\nexperiments on various datasets show that THP outperforms existing models in\nterms of both likelihood and event prediction accuracy by a notable margin.\nMoreover, THP is quite general and can incorporate additional structural\nknowledge. We provide a concrete example, where THP achieves improved\nprediction performance for learning multiple point processes when incorporating\ntheir relational information.",

To characterize the dynamic interactions among the individuals, we\npropose a group network Hawkes process (GNHP) model whose network structure is\nobserved and fixed. In particular, we introduce a latent group structure among\nindividuals to account for the heterogeneous user-specific characteristics. A\nmaximum likelihood approach is proposed to simultaneously cluster individuals\nin the network and estimate model parameters. A fast EM algorithm is\nsubsequently developed by utilizing the branching representation of the\nproposed GNHP model. Theoretical properties of the resulting estimators of\ngroup memberships and model parameters are investigated under both settings\nwhen the number of latent groups $G$ is over-specified or correctly specified.\nA data-driven criterion that can consistently identify the true $G$ under mild\nconditions is derived.

        "authors": "Albert Gu, Tri Dao",
        "abstract": "Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep\nlearning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its\ncore attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear\nattention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space\nmodels (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational\ninefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as\nattention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key\nweakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning,\nand make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be\nfunctions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities,\nallowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the\nsequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though\nthis change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a\nhardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these\nselective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without\nattention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$\nhigher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and\nits performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a\ngeneral sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language\nmodeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and\nmatches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream\nevaluation.",

        "abstract": "Addressing real-world optimization problems becomes particularly challenging\nwhen analytic objective functions or constraints are unavailable. While\nnumerous studies have addressed the issue of unknown objectives, limited\nresearch has focused on scenarios where feasibility constraints are not given\nexplicitly. Overlooking these constraints can lead to spurious solutions that\nare unrealistic in practice. To deal with such unknown constraints, we propose\nto perform optimization within the data manifold using diffusion models. To\nconstrain the optimization process to the data manifold, we reformulate the\noriginal optimization problem as a sampling problem from the product of the\nBoltzmann distribution defined by the objective function and the data\ndistribution learned by the diffusion model. Depending on the differentiability\nof the objective function, we propose two different sampling methods. For\ndifferentiable objectives, we propose a two-stage framework that begins with a\nguided diffusion process for warm-up, followed by a Langevin dynamics stage for\nfurther correction. For non-differentiable objectives, we propose an iterative\nimportance sampling strategy using the diffusion model as the proposal\ndistribution. Comprehensive experiments on a synthetic dataset, six real-world\nblack-box optimization datasets, and a multi-objective molecule optimization\ndataset show that our method achieves better or comparable performance with\nprevious state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "abstract": "A very simple way to improve the performance of almost any machine learning\nalgorithm is to train many different models on the same data and then to\naverage their predictions. Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole\nensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to\nallow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual\nmodels are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it\nis possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which\nis much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different\ncompression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show\nthat we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used\ncommercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a\nsingle model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more\nfull models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained\nclasses that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these\nspecialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.",

        "authors": "Johannes von Oswald, Eyvind Niklasson, Ettore Randazzo, Jo\u00e3o Sacramento, Alexander Mordvintsev, Andrey Zhmoginov, Max Vladymyrov",
        "abstract": "At present, the mechanisms of in-context learning in Transformers are not\nwell understood and remain mostly an intuition. In this paper, we suggest that\ntraining Transformers on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to\ngradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a simple\nweight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations induced\nby 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on a\nregression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when\ntraining self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks either the\nmodels learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or, remarkably, the\nweights found by optimization match the construction. Thus we show how trained\nTransformers become mesa-optimizers i.e. learn models by gradient descent in\ntheir forward pass. This allows us, at least in the domain of regression\nproblems, to mechanistically understand the inner workings of in-context\nlearning in optimized Transformers. Building on this insight, we furthermore\nidentify how Transformers surpass the performance of plain gradient descent by\nlearning an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models on deep data\nrepresentations to solve non-linear regression tasks. Finally, we discuss\nintriguing parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for in-context\nlearning termed induction-head (Olsson et al., 2022) and show how it could be\nunderstood as a specific case of in-context learning by gradient descent\nlearning within Transformers. Code to reproduce the experiments can be found at\nhttps://github.com/google-research/self-organising-systems/tree/master/transformers_learn_icl_by_gd .",

        "abstract": "Novel capacities of generative AI to analyze and generate cultural artifacts\nraise inevitable questions about the nature and value of artistic education and\nhuman expertise. Has AI already leveled the playing field between professional\nartists and laypeople, or do trained artistic expressive capacity, curation\nskills and experience instead enhance the ability to use these new tools? In\nthis pre-registered study, we conduct experimental comparisons between 50\nactive artists and a demographically matched sample of laypeople. We designed\ntwo tasks to approximate artistic practice for testing their capabilities in\nboth faithful and creative image creation: replicating a reference image, and\nmoving as far away as possible from it. We developed a bespoke platform where\nparticipants used a modern text-to-image model to complete both tasks. We also\ncollected and compared participants' sentiments towards AI. On average, artists\nproduced more faithful and creative outputs than their lay counterparts,\nalthough only by a small margin. While AI may ease content creation,\nprofessional expertise is still valuable - even within the confined space of\ngenerative AI itself. Finally, we also explored how well an exemplary\nvision-capable large language model (GPT-4o) would complete the same tasks, if\ngiven the role of an image generation agent, and found it performed on par in\ncopying but outperformed even artists in the creative task. The very best\nresults were still produced by humans in both tasks. These outcomes highlight\nthe importance of integrating artistic skills with AI training to prepare\nartists and other visual professionals for a technologically evolving\nlandscape. We see a potential in collaborative synergy with generative AI,\nwhich could reshape creative industries and education in the arts.",

The Forward-Forward algorithm replaces the\nforward and backward passes of backpropagation by two forward passes, one with\npositive (i.e. real) data and the other with negative data which could be\ngenerated by the network itself. Each layer has its own objective function\nwhich is simply to have high goodness for positive data and low goodness for\nnegative data. The sum of the squared activities in a layer can be used as the\ngoodness but there are many other possibilities, including minus the sum of the\nsquared activities. If the positive and negative passes could be separated in\ntime, the negative passes could be done offline, which would make the learning\nmuch simpler in the positive pass and allow video to be pipelined through the\nnetwork without ever storing activities or stopping to propagate derivatives.",

        "abstract": "Self-supervised models have been shown to produce comparable or better visual\nrepresentations than their supervised counterparts when trained offline on\nunlabeled data at scale. However, their efficacy is catastrophically reduced in\na Continual Learning (CL) scenario where data is presented to the model\nsequentially. In this paper, we show that self-supervised loss functions can be\nseamlessly converted into distillation mechanisms for CL by adding a predictor\nnetwork that maps the current state of the representations to their past state.\nThis enables us to devise a framework for Continual self-supervised visual\nrepresentation Learning that (i) significantly improves the quality of the\nlearned representations, (ii) is compatible with several state-of-the-art\nself-supervised objectives, and (iii) needs little to no hyperparameter tuning.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach empirically by training six\npopular self-supervised models in various CL settings.",

        "abstract": "With the continuous development of technological and educational innovation,\nlearners nowadays can obtain a variety of support from agents such as teachers,\npeers, education technologies, and recently, generative artificial intelligence\nsuch as ChatGPT. The concept of hybrid intelligence is still at a nascent\nstage, and how learners can benefit from a symbiotic relationship with various\nagents such as AI, human experts and intelligent learning systems is still\nunknown. The emerging concept of hybrid intelligence also lacks deep insights\nand understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of hybrid human-AI\nlearning based on strong empirical research. In order to address this gap, we\nconducted a randomised experimental study and compared learners' motivations,\nself-regulated learning processes and learning performances on a writing task\namong different groups who had support from different agents (ChatGPT, human\nexpert, writing analytics tools, and no extra tool). A total of 117 university\nstudents were recruited, and their multi-channel learning, performance and\nmotivation data were collected and analysed. The results revealed that:\nlearners who received different learning support showed no difference in\npost-task intrinsic motivation; there were significant differences in the\nfrequency and sequences of the self-regulated learning processes among groups;\nChatGPT group outperformed in the essay score improvement but their knowledge\ngain and transfer were not significantly different. Our research found that in\nthe absence of differences in motivation, learners with different supports\nstill exhibited different self-regulated learning processes, ultimately leading\nto differentiated performance. What is particularly noteworthy is that AI\ntechnologies such as ChatGPT may promote learners' dependence on technology and\npotentially trigger metacognitive laziness.",

We provide\nevidence against this claim and build a modern GAN baseline in a more\nprincipled manner. First, we derive a well-behaved regularized relativistic GAN\nloss that addresses issues of mode dropping and non-convergence that were\npreviously tackled via a bag of ad-hoc tricks. We analyze our loss\nmathematically and prove that it admits local convergence guarantees, unlike\nmost existing relativistic losses. Second, our new loss allows us to discard\nall ad-hoc tricks and replace outdated backbones used in common GANs with\nmodern architectures. Using StyleGAN2 as an example, we present a roadmap of\nsimplification and modernization that results in a new minimalist baseline --\nR3GAN.

Our extensive\nempirical investigation includes tens of thousands of models trained with all\ncombinations of three optimizers, four parameterizations, several alignment\nassumptions, more than a dozen learning rates, and fourteen model sizes up to\n26.8B parameters.

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in\ntheir formal reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematics. The GSM8K\nbenchmark is widely used to assess the mathematical reasoning of models on\ngrade-school-level questions. While the performance of LLMs on GSM8K has\nsignificantly improved in recent years, it remains unclear whether their\nmathematical reasoning capabilities have genuinely advanced, raising questions\nabout the reliability of the reported metrics. To address these concerns, we\nconduct a large-scale study on several SOTA open and closed models. To overcome\nthe limitations of existing evaluations, we introduce GSM-Symbolic, an improved\nbenchmark created from symbolic templates that allow for the generation of a\ndiverse set of questions. GSM-Symbolic enables more controllable evaluations,\nproviding key insights and more reliable metrics for measuring the reasoning\ncapabilities of models.Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit noticeable\nvariance when responding to different instantiations of the same question.\nSpecifically, the performance of all models declines when only the numerical\nvalues in the question are altered in the GSM-Symbolic benchmark. Furthermore,\nwe investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models and show\nthat their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in a\nquestion increases. We hypothesize that this decline is because current LLMs\ncannot perform genuine logical reasoning; they replicate reasoning steps from\ntheir training data. Adding a single clause that seems relevant to the question\ncauses significant performance drops (up to 65%) across all state-of-the-art\nmodels, even though the clause doesn't contribute to the reasoning chain needed\nfor the final answer. Overall, our work offers a more nuanced understanding of\nLLMs' capabilities and limitations in mathematical reasoning.",

        "authors": "Samyam Rajbhandari, Olatunji Ruwase, Jeff Rasley, Shaden Smith, Yuxiong He",
        "abstract": "In the last three years, the largest dense deep learning models have grown\nover 1000x to reach hundreds of billions of parameters, while the GPU memory\nhas only grown by 5x (16 GB to 80 GB). Therefore, the growth in model scale has\nbeen supported primarily though system innovations that allow large models to\nfit in the aggregate GPU memory of multiple GPUs. However, we are getting close\nto the GPU memory wall. It requires 800 NVIDIA V100 GPUs just to fit a trillion\nparameter model for training, and such clusters are simply out of reach for\nmost data scientists. In addition, training models at that scale requires\ncomplex combinations of parallelism techniques that puts a big burden on the\ndata scientists to refactor their model.\n  In this paper we present ZeRO-Infinity, a novel heterogeneous system\ntechnology that leverages GPU, CPU, and NVMe memory to allow for unprecedented\nmodel scale on limited resources without requiring model code refactoring. At\nthe same time it achieves excellent training throughput and scalability,\nunencumbered by the limited CPU or NVMe bandwidth. ZeRO-Infinity can fit models\nwith tens and even hundreds of trillions of parameters for training on current\ngeneration GPU clusters. It can be used to fine-tune trillion parameter models\non a single NVIDIA DGX-2 node, making large models more accessible. In terms of\ntraining throughput and scalability, it sustains over 25 petaflops on 512\nNVIDIA V100 GPUs(40% of peak), while also demonstrating super linear\nscalability. An open source implementation of ZeRO-Infinity is available\nthrough DeepSpeed, a deep learning optimization library that makes distributed\ntraining easy, efficient, and effective.",

        "authors": "Ali Behrouz, Peilin Zhong, Vahab Mirrokni",
        "abstract": "Over more than a decade there has been an extensive research effort on how to\neffectively utilize recurrent models and attention. While recurrent models aim\nto compress the data into a fixed-size memory (called hidden state), attention\nallows attending to the entire context window, capturing the direct\ndependencies of all tokens. This more accurate modeling of dependencies,\nhowever, comes with a quadratic cost, limiting the model to a fixed-length\ncontext. We present a new neural long-term memory module that learns to\nmemorize historical context and helps attention to attend to the current\ncontext while utilizing long past information. We show that this neural memory\nhas the advantage of fast parallelizable training while maintaining a fast\ninference. From a memory perspective, we argue that attention due to its\nlimited context but accurate dependency modeling performs as a short-term\nmemory, while neural memory due to its ability to memorize the data, acts as a\nlong-term, more persistent, memory. Based on these two modules, we introduce a\nnew family of architectures, called Titans, and present three variants to\naddress how one can effectively incorporate memory into this architecture. Our\nexperimental results on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, genomics,\nand time series tasks show that Titans are more effective than Transformers and\nrecent modern linear recurrent models. They further can effectively scale to\nlarger than 2M context window size with higher accuracy in needle-in-haystack\ntasks compared to baselines.",

        "authors": "Shibo Hao, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, DiJia Su, Xian Li, Zhiting Hu, Jason Weston, Yuandong Tian",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are restricted to reason in the \"language\nspace\", where they typically express the reasoning process with a\nchain-of-thought (CoT) to solve a complex reasoning problem. However, we argue\nthat language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, most\nword tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for\nreasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge\nchallenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an\nunrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new\nparadigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). We utilize the last hidden\nstate of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed \"continuous\nthought\"). Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the\nLLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space.\nExperiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several\nreasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent\nadvanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple\nalternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first\nsearch (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a\nsingle deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical\nreasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with\nfewer thinking tokens during inference. These findings demonstrate the promise\nof latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research.",

        "abstract": "Hierarchical forecasting methods have been widely used to support aligned\ndecision-making by providing coherent forecasts at different aggregation\nlevels. Traditional hierarchical forecasting approaches, such as the bottom-up\nand top-down methods, focus on a particular aggregation level to anchor the\nforecasts. During the past decades, these have been replaced by a variety of\nlinear combination approaches that exploit information from the complete\nhierarchy to produce more accurate forecasts. However, the performance of these\ncombination methods depends on the particularities of the examined series and\ntheir relationships. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical forecasting\napproach based on machine learning that deals with these limitations in three\nimportant ways. First, the proposed method allows for a non-linear combination\nof the base forecasts, thus being more general than the linear approaches.\nSecond, it structurally combines the objectives of improved post-sample\nempirical forecasting accuracy and coherence. Finally, due to its non-linear\nnature, our approach selectively combines the base forecasts in a direct and\nautomated way without requiring that the complete information must be used for\nproducing reconciled forecasts for each series and level. The proposed method\nis evaluated both in terms of accuracy and bias using two different data sets\ncoming from the tourism and retail industries. Our results suggest that the\nproposed method gives superior point forecasts than existing approaches,\nespecially when the series comprising the hierarchy are not characterized by\nthe same patterns.",

        "authors": "Andrea Galeotti, Benjamin Golub, Sanjeev Goyal",
        "abstract": "We study games in which a network mediates strategic spillovers and\nexternalities among the players. How does a planner optimally target\ninterventions that change individuals' private returns to investment? We\nanalyze this question by decomposing any intervention into orthogonal principal\ncomponents, which are determined by the network and are ordered according to\ntheir associated eigenvalues. There is a close connection between the nature of\nspillovers and the representation of various principal components in the\noptimal intervention. In games of strategic complements (substitutes),\ninterventions place more weight on the top (bottom) principal components, which\nreflect more global (local) network structure. For large budgets, optimal\ninterventions are simple -- they involve a single principal component.",

        "authors": "Chenyan Jia, Michelle S. Lam, Minh Chau Mai, Jeff Hancock, Michael S. Bernstein",
        "abstract": "Can we design artificial intelligence (AI) systems that rank our social media\nfeeds to consider democratic values such as mitigating partisan animosity as\npart of their objective functions? We introduce a method for translating\nestablished, vetted social scientific constructs into AI objective functions,\nwhich we term societal objective functions, and demonstrate the method with\napplication to the political science construct of anti-democratic attitudes.\nTraditionally, we have lacked observable outcomes to use to train such models,\nhowever, the social sciences have developed survey instruments and qualitative\ncodebooks for these constructs, and their precision facilitates translation\ninto detailed prompts for large language models. We apply this method to create\na democratic attitude model that estimates the extent to which a social media\npost promotes anti-democratic attitudes, and test this democratic attitude\nmodel across three studies. In Study 1, we first test the attitudinal and\nbehavioral effectiveness of the intervention among US partisans (N=1,380) by\nmanually annotating (alpha=.895) social media posts with anti-democratic\nattitude scores and testing several feed ranking conditions based on these\nscores. Removal (d=.20) and downranking feeds (d=.25) reduced participants'\npartisan animosity without compromising their experience and engagement. In\nStudy 2, we scale up the manual labels by creating the democratic attitude\nmodel, finding strong agreement with manual labels (rho=.75). Finally, in Study\n3, we replicate Study 1 using the democratic attitude model instead of manual\nlabels to test its attitudinal and behavioral impact (N=558), and again find\nthat the feed downranking using the societal objective function reduced\npartisan animosity (d=.25). This method presents a novel strategy to draw on\nsocial science theory and methods to mitigate societal harms in social media\nAIs.",

        "authors": "Charbel Sakr, Brucek Khailany",
        "abstract": "We propose ESPACE, an LLM compression technique based on dimensionality\nreduction of activations. Unlike prior works on weight-centric tensor\ndecomposition, ESPACE projects activations onto a pre-calibrated set of\nprincipal components. The activation-centrality of the approach enables\nretraining LLMs with no loss of expressivity; while at inference, weight\ndecomposition is obtained as a byproduct of matrix multiplication\nassociativity. Theoretical results on the construction of projection matrices\nwith optimal computational accuracy are provided. Experimentally, we find\nESPACE enables 50% compression of GPT3, Llama2, and Nemotron4 models with small\naccuracy degradation, as low as a 0.18 perplexity increase on GPT3-22B. At\nlower compression rates of 20% to 40%, ESPACE drives GPT3 models to\noutperforming their baseline, by up to a 0.38 decrease in perplexity for\nGPT3-8B. ESPACE also reduces GEMM execution time and prefill inference latency\non existing hardware. Comparison with related works on compressing Llama2-7B\nvia matrix factorization shows that ESPACE is a first step in advancing the\nstate-of-the-art in tensor decomposition compression of LLMs.",

        "authors": "Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Yadong Lu, Yelong Shen, Chen Liang, Weizhu Chen",
        "abstract": "Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has long been a\nchallenging problem. Previous approaches have either suffered from quadratic\ncomputational complexity or limited extrapolation ability in length\ngeneralization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture\nthat layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with\nSliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence\ninto recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely\nrecall recent memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B\nparameters with 3.2T training tokens and demonstrate that it significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art models across a variety of benchmarks. Pretrained\non sequences of 4K length, Samba shows improved perplexity in context lengths\nof up to 1M in zero-shot. When finetuned on 4K-length sequences, Samba\nefficiently extrapolates to a 256K context length with perfect memory recall on\nthe Passkey Retrieval task, and exhibits superior retrieval extrapolation on\nthe challenging Phonebook task compared to full-attention models. As a\nlinear-time sequence model, Samba achieves a 3.73x higher throughput compared\nto Transformers with grouped-query attention for user prompts of 128K length,\nand a 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming.

        "abstract": "We argue that representations in AI models, particularly deep networks, are\nconverging. First, we survey many examples of convergence in the literature:\nover time and across multiple domains, the ways by which different neural\nnetworks represent data are becoming more aligned. Next, we demonstrate\nconvergence across data modalities: as vision models and language models get\nlarger, they measure distance between datapoints in a more and more alike way.\nWe hypothesize that this convergence is driving toward a shared statistical\nmodel of reality, akin to Plato's concept of an ideal reality. We term such a\nrepresentation the platonic representation and discuss several possible\nselective pressures toward it. Finally, we discuss the implications of these\ntrends, their limitations, and counterexamples to our analysis.",

        "abstract": "Multi-view 3D reconstruction remains a core challenge in computer vision,\nparticularly in applications requiring accurate and scalable representations\nacross diverse perspectives. Current leading methods such as DUSt3R employ a\nfundamentally pairwise approach, processing images in pairs and necessitating\ncostly global alignment procedures to reconstruct from multiple views. In this\nwork, we propose Fast 3D Reconstruction (Fast3R), a novel multi-view\ngeneralization to DUSt3R that achieves efficient and scalable 3D reconstruction\nby processing many views in parallel. Fast3R's Transformer-based architecture\nforwards N images in a single forward pass, bypassing the need for iterative\nalignment. Through extensive experiments on camera pose estimation and 3D\nreconstruction, Fast3R demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with\nsignificant improvements in inference speed and reduced error accumulation.\nThese results establish Fast3R as a robust alternative for multi-view\napplications, offering enhanced scalability without compromising reconstruction\naccuracy.",

        "abstract": "Out of equilibrium, the lack of reciprocity is the rule rather than the\nexception. Non-reciprocal interactions occur, for instance, in networks of\nneurons, directional growth of interfaces, and synthetic active materials.\nWhile wave propagation in non-reciprocal media has recently been under intense\nstudy, less is known about the consequences of non-reciprocity on the\ncollective behavior of many-body systems. Here, we show that non-reciprocity\nleads to time-dependent phases where spontaneously broken symmetries are\ndynamically restored. The resulting phase transitions are controlled by\nspectral singularities called exceptional points. We describe the emergence of\nthese phases using insights from bifurcation theory and non-Hermitian quantum\nmechanics. Our approach captures non-reciprocal generalizations of three\narchetypal classes of self-organization out of equilibrium: synchronization,\nflocking and pattern formation. Collective phenomena in these non-reciprocal\nsystems range from active time-(quasi)crystals to exceptional-point enforced\npattern-formation and hysteresis. Our work paves the way towards a general\ntheory of critical phenomena in non-reciprocal matter.",

        "abstract": "Bifurcations can cause dynamical systems with slowly varying parameters to\ntransition to far-away attractors. The terms ``critical transition'' or\n``tipping point'' have been used to describe this situation. Critical\ntransitions have been observed in an astonishingly diverse set of applications\nfrom ecosystems and climate change to medicine and finance. The main goal of\nthis paper is to give an overview which standard mathematical theories can be\napplied to critical transitions. We shall focus on early-warning signs that\nhave been suggested to predict critical transitions and point out what\nmathematical theory can provide in this context. Starting from classical\nbifurcation theory and incorporating multiple time scale dynamics one can give\na detailed analysis of local bifurcations that induce critical transitions. We\nsuggest that the mathematical theory of fast-slow systems provides a natural\ndefinition of critical transitions. Since noise often plays a crucial role near\ncritical transitions the next step is to consider stochastic fast-slow systems.\nThe interplay between sample path techniques, partial differential equations\nand random dynamical systems is highlighted. Each viewpoint provides potential\nearly-warning signs for critical transitions. Since increasing variance has\nbeen suggested as an early-warning sign we examine it in the context of normal\nforms analytically, numerically and geometrically; we also consider\nautocorrelation numerically. Hence we demonstrate the applicability of\nearly-warning signs for generic models. We end with suggestions for future\ndirections of the theory.",

However, their roles in\nenhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies\nthe difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing\non text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an\narithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation\nenvironment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen\nvariants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when\ntrained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based\ntextual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data\nand struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis\nreveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition\ncapabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain.\nDespite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for\neffective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling\nsubsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the\ncapability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal\ntasks.",

Key to Fastfood is the observation\nthat Hadamard matrices, when combined with diagonal Gaussian matrices, exhibit\nproperties similar to dense Gaussian random matrices. Yet unlike the latter,\nHadamard and diagonal matrices are inexpensive to multiply and store. These two\nmatrices can be used in lieu of Gaussian matrices in Random Kitchen Sinks\nproposed by Rahimi and Recht (2009) and thereby speeding up the computation for\na large range of kernel functions. Specifically, Fastfood requires O(n log d)\ntime and O(n) storage to compute n non-linear basis functions in d dimensions,\na significant improvement from O(nd) computation and storage, without\nsacrificing accuracy.\n  Our method applies to any translation invariant and any dot-product kernel,\nsuch as the popular RBF kernels and polynomial kernels. We prove that the\napproximation is unbiased and has low variance. Experiments show that we\nachieve similar accuracy to full kernel expansions and Random Kitchen Sinks\nwhile being 100x faster and using 1000x less memory. These improvements,\nespecially in terms of memory usage, make kernel methods more practical for\napplications that have large training sets and/or require real-time prediction.",

In a\nsupervised learning context, no iterative optimization or gradient computations\nof internal network parameters are needed to obtain a trained network. The\nsampling is based on the idea of random feature models. However, instead of a\ndata-agnostic distribution, e.g., a normal distribution, we use both the input\nand the output training data to sample shallow and deep networks. We prove that\nsampled networks are universal approximators. For Barron functions, we show\nthat the $L^2$-approximation error of sampled shallow networks decreases with\nthe square root of the number of neurons. Our sampling scheme is invariant to\nrigid body transformations and scaling of the input data, which implies many\npopular pre-processing techniques are not required. In numerical experiments,\nwe demonstrate that sampled networks achieve accuracy comparable to iteratively\ntrained ones, but can be constructed orders of magnitude faster.

        "abstract": "In an increasing number of domains it has been demonstrated that deep\nlearning models can be trained using relatively large batch sizes without\nsacrificing data efficiency. However the limits of this massive data\nparallelism seem to differ from domain to domain, ranging from batches of tens\nof thousands in ImageNet to batches of millions in RL agents that play the game\nDota 2. To our knowledge there is limited conceptual understanding of why these\nlimits to batch size differ or how we might choose the correct batch size in a\nnew domain. In this paper, we demonstrate that a simple and easy-to-measure\nstatistic called the gradient noise scale predicts the largest useful batch\nsize across many domains and applications, including a number of supervised\nlearning datasets (MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, Billion Word),\nreinforcement learning domains (Atari and Dota), and even generative model\ntraining (autoencoders on SVHN). We find that the noise scale increases as the\nloss decreases over a training run and depends on the model size primarily\nthrough improved model performance.

        "abstract": "Confronting the escalating threat of climate change requires innovative and\nlarge-scale interventions. This paper presents a bold proposal to employ a\nburied nuclear explosion in a remote basaltic seabed for pulverizing basalt,\nthereby accelerating carbon sequestration through Enhanced Rock Weathering\n(ERW). By precisely locating the explosion beneath the seabed, we aim to\nconfine debris, radiation, and energy while ensuring rapid rock weathering at a\nscale substantial enough to make a meaningful dent in atmospheric carbon\nlevels. Our analysis outlines the parameters essential for efficient carbon\ncapture and minimal collateral effects, emphasizing that a yield on the order\nof gigatons is critical for global climate impact. Although this approach may\nappear radical, we illustrate its feasibility by examining safety factors,\npreservation of local ecosystems, political considerations, and financial\nviability. This work argues for reimagining nuclear technology not merely as a\ndestructive force but as a potential catalyst for decarbonization, thereby\ninviting further exploration of pioneering solutions in the fight against\nclimate change.",

Our work implies limitations on\nthe quantum advantage in the distributed setting, and we also exhibit a new\nbarrier for proving tighter bounds. Our main technical results are these: 1.\nAll LCL problems solvable with locality $O(\\log^\\star n)$ in the classical\ndeterministic LOCAL model admit a finitely-dependent distribution with locality\n$O(1)$. This answers an open question by Holroyd [2024], and also presents a\nnew barrier for proving bounds on distributed quantum advantage using\ncausality-based arguments. 2. In rooted trees, if we can solve an LCL problem\nwith locality $o(\\log \\log \\log n)$ in the randomized online-LOCAL model (or\nany of the weaker models, such as quantum-LOCAL), we can solve it with locality\n$O(\\log^\\star n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model. One of many\nimplications is that in rooted trees, $O(\\log^\\star n)$ locality in\nquantum-LOCAL is not stronger than $O(\\log^\\star n)$ locality in classical\nLOCAL.",

The introductory chapters also provide background material on\nmatrix analysis and optimization. The latter chapter provides theoretical\nsupport to many algorithms that are used in the book, including stochastic\ngradient descent, proximal methods, etc. After discussing basic concepts for\nstatistical prediction, the book includes an introduction to reproducing kernel\ntheory and Hilbert space techniques, which are used in many places, before\naddressing the description of various algorithms for supervised statistical\nlearning, including linear methods, support vector machines, decision trees,\nboosting, or neural networks. The subject then switches to generative methods,\nstarting with a chapter that presents sampling methods and an introduction to\nthe theory of Markov chains. The following chapter describe the theory of\ngraphical models, an introduction to variational methods for models with latent\nvariables, and to deep-learning based generative models. The next chapters\nfocus on unsupervised learning methods, for clustering, factor analysis and\nmanifold learning. The final chapter of the book is theory-oriented and\ndiscusses concentration inequalities and generalization bounds.",

        "authors": "Chris Mingard, Guillermo Valle-P\u00e9rez, Joar Skalse, Ard A. Louis",
        "abstract": "Overparameterised deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly expressive and so\ncan, in principle, generate almost any function that fits a training dataset\nwith zero error. The vast majority of these functions will perform poorly on\nunseen data, and yet in practice DNNs often generalise remarkably well. This\nsuccess suggests that a trained DNN must have a strong inductive bias towards\nfunctions with low generalisation error. Here we empirically investigate this\ninductive bias by calculating, for a range of architectures and datasets, the\nprobability $P_{SGD}(f\\mid S)$ that an overparameterised DNN, trained with\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) or one of its variants, converges on a\nfunction $f$ consistent with a training set $S$. We also use Gaussian processes\nto estimate the Bayesian posterior probability $P_B(f\\mid S)$ that the DNN\nexpresses $f$ upon random sampling of its parameters, conditioned on $S$.\n  Our main findings are that $P_{SGD}(f\\mid S)$ correlates remarkably well with\n$P_B(f\\mid S)$ and that $P_B(f\\mid S)$ is strongly biased towards low-error and\nlow complexity functions. These results imply that strong inductive bias in the\nparameter-function map (which determines $P_B(f\\mid S)$), rather than a special\nproperty of SGD, is the primary explanation for why DNNs generalise so well in\nthe overparameterised regime.\n  While our results suggest that the Bayesian posterior $P_B(f\\mid S)$ is the\nfirst order determinant of $P_{SGD}(f\\mid S)$, there remain second order\ndifferences that are sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. A function probability\npicture, based on $P_{SGD}(f\\mid S)$ and/or $P_B(f\\mid S)$, can shed new light\non the way that variations in architecture or hyperparameter settings such as\nbatch size, learning rate, and optimiser choice, affect DNN performance.",

We present CREATIVITY INDEX as the first step to\nquantify the linguistic creativity of a text by reconstructing it from existing\ntext snippets on the web. CREATIVITY INDEX is motivated by the hypothesis that\nthe seemingly remarkable creativity of LLMs may be attributable in large part\nto the creativity of human-written texts on the web. To compute CREATIVITY\nINDEX efficiently, we introduce DJ SEARCH, a novel dynamic programming\nalgorithm that can search verbatim and near-verbatim matches of text snippets\nfrom a given document against the web. Experiments reveal that the CREATIVITY\nINDEX of professional human authors is on average 66.2% higher than that of\nLLMs, and that alignment reduces the CREATIVITY INDEX of LLMs by an average of\n30.1%. In addition, we find that distinguished authors like Hemingway exhibit\nmeasurably higher CREATIVITY INDEX compared to other human writers. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that CREATIVITY INDEX can be used as a surprisingly effective\ncriterion for zero-shot machine text detection, surpassing the strongest\nexisting zero-shot system, DetectGPT, by a significant margin of 30.2%, and\neven outperforming the strongest supervised system, GhostBuster, in five out of\nsix domains.",

        "abstract": "End-to-end human animation, such as audio-driven talking human generation,\nhas undergone notable advancements in the recent few years. However, existing\nmethods still struggle to scale up as large general video generation models,\nlimiting their potential in real applications. In this paper, we propose\nOmniHuman, a Diffusion Transformer-based framework that scales up data by\nmixing motion-related conditions into the training phase. To this end, we\nintroduce two training principles for these mixed conditions, along with the\ncorresponding model architecture and inference strategy. These designs enable\nOmniHuman to fully leverage data-driven motion generation, ultimately achieving\nhighly realistic human video generation. More importantly, OmniHuman supports\nvarious portrait contents (face close-up, portrait, half-body, full-body),\nsupports both talking and singing, handles human-object interactions and\nchallenging body poses, and accommodates different image styles. Compared to\nexisting end-to-end audio-driven methods, OmniHuman not only produces more\nrealistic videos, but also offers greater flexibility in inputs. It also\nsupports multiple driving modalities (audio-driven, video-driven and combined\ndriving signals). Video samples are provided on the ttfamily project page\n(https://omnihuman-lab.github.io)",

        "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in\ncoarse-grained tasks like image classification and retrieval. However, they\nstruggle with fine-grained tasks that require localized understanding. To\ninvestigate this weakness, we comprehensively analyze CLIP features and\nidentify an important issue: semantic features are highly correlated.\nSpecifically, the features of a class encode information about other classes,\nwhich we call mutual feature information (MFI). This mutual information becomes\nevident when we query a specific class and unrelated objects are activated\nalong with the target class. To address this issue, we propose Unmix-CLIP, a\nnovel framework designed to reduce MFI and improve feature disentanglement. We\nintroduce MFI loss, which explicitly separates text features by projecting them\ninto a space where inter-class similarity is minimized. To ensure a\ncorresponding separation in image features, we use multi-label recognition\n(MLR) to align the image features with the separated text features. This\nensures that both image and text features are disentangled and aligned across\nmodalities, improving feature separation for downstream tasks. For the COCO- 14\ndataset, Unmix-CLIP reduces feature similarity by 24.9%. We demonstrate its\neffectiveness through extensive evaluations of MLR and zeroshot semantic\nsegmentation (ZS3). In MLR, our method performs competitively on the VOC2007\nand surpasses SOTA approaches on the COCO-14 dataset, using fewer training\nparameters. Additionally, Unmix-CLIP consistently outperforms existing ZS3\nmethods on COCO and VOC",

        "authors": "Chris Wendler, Veniamin Veselovsky, Giovanni Monea, Robert West",
        "abstract": "We ask whether multilingual language models trained on unbalanced,\nEnglish-dominated corpora use English as an internal pivot language -- a\nquestion of key importance for understanding how language models function and\nthe origins of linguistic bias. Focusing on the Llama-2 family of transformer\nmodels, our study uses carefully constructed non-English prompts with a unique\ncorrect single-token continuation. From layer to layer, transformers gradually\nmap an input embedding of the final prompt token to an output embedding from\nwhich next-token probabilities are computed. Tracking intermediate embeddings\nthrough their high-dimensional space reveals three distinct phases, whereby\nintermediate embeddings (1) start far away from output token embeddings; (2)\nalready allow for decoding a semantically correct next token in the middle\nlayers, but give higher probability to its version in English than in the input\nlanguage; (3) finally move into an input-language-specific region of the\nembedding space. We cast these results into a conceptual model where the three\nphases operate in \"input space\", \"concept space\", and \"output space\",\nrespectively. Crucially, our evidence suggests that the abstract \"concept\nspace\" lies closer to English than to other languages, which may have important\nconsequences regarding the biases held by multilingual language models.",
