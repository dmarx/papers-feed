        "authors": "Lisa Schut, Nenad Tomasev, Tom McGrath, Demis Hassabis, Ulrich Paquet, Been Kim",
        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have made remarkable progress, attaining\nsuper-human performance across various domains. This presents us with an\nopportunity to further human knowledge and improve human expert performance by\nleveraging the hidden knowledge encoded within these highly performant AI\nsystems. Yet, this knowledge is often hard to extract, and may be hard to\nunderstand or learn from. Here, we show that this is possible by proposing a\nnew method that allows us to extract new chess concepts in AlphaZero, an AI\nsystem that mastered the game of chess via self-play without human supervision.\nOur analysis indicates that AlphaZero may encode knowledge that extends beyond\nthe existing human knowledge, but knowledge that is ultimately not beyond human\ngrasp, and can be successfully learned from. In a human study, we show that\nthese concepts are learnable by top human experts, as four top chess\ngrandmasters show improvements in solving the presented concept prototype\npositions. This marks an important first milestone in advancing the frontier of\nhuman knowledge by leveraging AI; a development that could bear profound\nimplications and help us shape how we interact with AI systems across many AI\napplications.",

        "title": "Grokking at the Edge of Numerical Stability",
        "authors": "Lucas Prieto, Melih Barsbey, Pedro A. M. Mediano, Tolga Birdal",
        "abstract": "Grokking, the sudden generalization that occurs after prolonged overfitting,\nis a surprising phenomenon challenging our understanding of deep learning.\nAlthough significant progress has been made in understanding grokking, the\nreasons behind the delayed generalization and its dependence on regularization\nremain unclear. In this work, we argue that without regularization, grokking\ntasks push models to the edge of numerical stability, introducing floating\npoint errors in the Softmax function, which we refer to as Softmax Collapse\n(SC). We demonstrate that SC prevents grokking and that mitigating SC enables\ngrokking without regularization. Investigating the root cause of SC, we find\nthat beyond the point of overfitting, the gradients strongly align with what we\ncall the na\\\"ive loss minimization (NLM) direction. This component of the\ngradient does not alter the model's predictions but decreases the loss by\nscaling the logits, typically by scaling the weights along their current\ndirection. We show that this scaling of the logits explains the delay in\ngeneralization characteristic of grokking and eventually leads to SC, halting\nfurther learning. To validate our hypotheses, we introduce two key\ncontributions that address the challenges in grokking tasks: StableMax, a new\nactivation function that prevents SC and enables grokking without\nregularization, and $\\perp$Grad, a training algorithm that promotes quick\ngeneralization in grokking tasks by preventing NLM altogether. These\ncontributions provide new insights into grokking, elucidating its delayed\ngeneralization, reliance on regularization, and the effectiveness of existing\ngrokking-inducing methods.

        "abstract": "Modern data acquisition routinely produce massive amounts of event sequence\ndata in various domains, such as social media, healthcare, and financial\nmarkets. These data often exhibit complicated short-term and long-term temporal\ndependencies. However, most of the existing recurrent neural network based\npoint process models fail to capture such dependencies, and yield unreliable\nprediction performance. To address this issue, we propose a Transformer Hawkes\nProcess (THP) model, which leverages the self-attention mechanism to capture\nlong-term dependencies and meanwhile enjoys computational efficiency. Numerical\nexperiments on various datasets show that THP outperforms existing models in\nterms of both likelihood and event prediction accuracy by a notable margin.\nMoreover, THP is quite general and can incorporate additional structural\nknowledge. We provide a concrete example, where THP achieves improved\nprediction performance for learning multiple point processes when incorporating\ntheir relational information.",

To characterize the dynamic interactions among the individuals, we\npropose a group network Hawkes process (GNHP) model whose network structure is\nobserved and fixed. In particular, we introduce a latent group structure among\nindividuals to account for the heterogeneous user-specific characteristics. A\nmaximum likelihood approach is proposed to simultaneously cluster individuals\nin the network and estimate model parameters. A fast EM algorithm is\nsubsequently developed by utilizing the branching representation of the\nproposed GNHP model. Theoretical properties of the resulting estimators of\ngroup memberships and model parameters are investigated under both settings\nwhen the number of latent groups $G$ is over-specified or correctly specified.\nA data-driven criterion that can consistently identify the true $G$ under mild\nconditions is derived.

        "authors": "Albert Gu, Tri Dao",
        "abstract": "Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep\nlearning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its\ncore attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear\nattention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space\nmodels (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational\ninefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as\nattention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key\nweakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning,\nand make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be\nfunctions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities,\nallowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the\nsequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though\nthis change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a\nhardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these\nselective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without\nattention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$\nhigher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and\nits performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a\ngeneral sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language\nmodeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and\nmatches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream\nevaluation.",

        "abstract": "Addressing real-world optimization problems becomes particularly challenging\nwhen analytic objective functions or constraints are unavailable. While\nnumerous studies have addressed the issue of unknown objectives, limited\nresearch has focused on scenarios where feasibility constraints are not given\nexplicitly. Overlooking these constraints can lead to spurious solutions that\nare unrealistic in practice. To deal with such unknown constraints, we propose\nto perform optimization within the data manifold using diffusion models. To\nconstrain the optimization process to the data manifold, we reformulate the\noriginal optimization problem as a sampling problem from the product of the\nBoltzmann distribution defined by the objective function and the data\ndistribution learned by the diffusion model. Depending on the differentiability\nof the objective function, we propose two different sampling methods. For\ndifferentiable objectives, we propose a two-stage framework that begins with a\nguided diffusion process for warm-up, followed by a Langevin dynamics stage for\nfurther correction. For non-differentiable objectives, we propose an iterative\nimportance sampling strategy using the diffusion model as the proposal\ndistribution. Comprehensive experiments on a synthetic dataset, six real-world\nblack-box optimization datasets, and a multi-objective molecule optimization\ndataset show that our method achieves better or comparable performance with\nprevious state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "abstract": "A very simple way to improve the performance of almost any machine learning\nalgorithm is to train many different models on the same data and then to\naverage their predictions. Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole\nensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to\nallow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual\nmodels are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it\nis possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which\nis much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different\ncompression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show\nthat we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used\ncommercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a\nsingle model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more\nfull models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained\nclasses that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these\nspecialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.",

        "authors": "Johannes von Oswald, Eyvind Niklasson, Ettore Randazzo, Jo\u00e3o Sacramento, Alexander Mordvintsev, Andrey Zhmoginov, Max Vladymyrov",
        "abstract": "At present, the mechanisms of in-context learning in Transformers are not\nwell understood and remain mostly an intuition. In this paper, we suggest that\ntraining Transformers on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to\ngradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a simple\nweight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations induced\nby 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on a\nregression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when\ntraining self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks either the\nmodels learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or, remarkably, the\nweights found by optimization match the construction. Thus we show how trained\nTransformers become mesa-optimizers i.e. learn models by gradient descent in\ntheir forward pass. This allows us, at least in the domain of regression\nproblems, to mechanistically understand the inner workings of in-context\nlearning in optimized Transformers. Building on this insight, we furthermore\nidentify how Transformers surpass the performance of plain gradient descent by\nlearning an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models on deep data\nrepresentations to solve non-linear regression tasks. Finally, we discuss\nintriguing parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for in-context\nlearning termed induction-head (Olsson et al., 2022) and show how it could be\nunderstood as a specific case of in-context learning by gradient descent\nlearning within Transformers. Code to reproduce the experiments can be found at\nhttps://github.com/google-research/self-organising-systems/tree/master/transformers_learn_icl_by_gd .",

        "abstract": "Novel capacities of generative AI to analyze and generate cultural artifacts\nraise inevitable questions about the nature and value of artistic education and\nhuman expertise. Has AI already leveled the playing field between professional\nartists and laypeople, or do trained artistic expressive capacity, curation\nskills and experience instead enhance the ability to use these new tools? In\nthis pre-registered study, we conduct experimental comparisons between 50\nactive artists and a demographically matched sample of laypeople. We designed\ntwo tasks to approximate artistic practice for testing their capabilities in\nboth faithful and creative image creation: replicating a reference image, and\nmoving as far away as possible from it. We developed a bespoke platform where\nparticipants used a modern text-to-image model to complete both tasks. We also\ncollected and compared participants' sentiments towards AI. On average, artists\nproduced more faithful and creative outputs than their lay counterparts,\nalthough only by a small margin. While AI may ease content creation,\nprofessional expertise is still valuable - even within the confined space of\ngenerative AI itself. Finally, we also explored how well an exemplary\nvision-capable large language model (GPT-4o) would complete the same tasks, if\ngiven the role of an image generation agent, and found it performed on par in\ncopying but outperformed even artists in the creative task. The very best\nresults were still produced by humans in both tasks. These outcomes highlight\nthe importance of integrating artistic skills with AI training to prepare\nartists and other visual professionals for a technologically evolving\nlandscape. We see a potential in collaborative synergy with generative AI,\nwhich could reshape creative industries and education in the arts.",

At the end of learning, we obtain\nback a single model by taking a spatial average in weight space. To avoid\nincurring increased computational costs, we investigate a family of\nlow-dimensional late-phase weight models which interact multiplicatively with\nthe remaining parameters. Our results show that augmenting standard models with\nlate-phase weights improves generalization in established benchmarks such as\nCIFAR-10/100, ImageNet and enwik8.

        "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to introduce a new learning procedure for neural\nnetworks and to demonstrate that it works well enough on a few small problems\nto be worth further investigation. The Forward-Forward algorithm replaces the\nforward and backward passes of backpropagation by two forward passes, one with\npositive (i.e. real) data and the other with negative data which could be\ngenerated by the network itself. Each layer has its own objective function\nwhich is simply to have high goodness for positive data and low goodness for\nnegative data. The sum of the squared activities in a layer can be used as the\ngoodness but there are many other possibilities, including minus the sum of the\nsquared activities. If the positive and negative passes could be separated in\ntime, the negative passes could be done offline, which would make the learning\nmuch simpler in the positive pass and allow video to be pipelined through the\nnetwork without ever storing activities or stopping to propagate derivatives.",

The concept of hybrid intelligence is still at a nascent\nstage, and how learners can benefit from a symbiotic relationship with various\nagents such as AI, human experts and intelligent learning systems is still\nunknown. The emerging concept of hybrid intelligence also lacks deep insights\nand understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of hybrid human-AI\nlearning based on strong empirical research. In order to address this gap, we\nconducted a randomised experimental study and compared learners' motivations,\nself-regulated learning processes and learning performances on a writing task\namong different groups who had support from different agents (ChatGPT, human\nexpert, writing analytics tools, and no extra tool). A total of 117 university\nstudents were recruited, and their multi-channel learning, performance and\nmotivation data were collected and analysed. The results revealed that:\nlearners who received different learning support showed no difference in\npost-task intrinsic motivation; there were significant differences in the\nfrequency and sequences of the self-regulated learning processes among groups;\nChatGPT group outperformed in the essay score improvement but their knowledge\ngain and transfer were not significantly different. Our research found that in\nthe absence of differences in motivation, learners with different supports\nstill exhibited different self-regulated learning processes, ultimately leading\nto differentiated performance. What is particularly noteworthy is that AI\ntechnologies such as ChatGPT may promote learners' dependence on technology and\npotentially trigger metacognitive laziness.",

We analyze our loss\nmathematically and prove that it admits local convergence guarantees, unlike\nmost existing relativistic losses. Second, our new loss allows us to discard\nall ad-hoc tricks and replace outdated backbones used in common GANs with\nmodern architectures. Using StyleGAN2 as an example, we present a roadmap of\nsimplification and modernization that results in a new minimalist baseline --\nR3GAN.

Our extensive\nempirical investigation includes tens of thousands of models trained with all\ncombinations of three optimizers, four parameterizations, several alignment\nassumptions, more than a dozen learning rates, and fourteen model sizes up to\n26.8B parameters. We find that the best learning rate scaling prescription\nwould often have been excluded by the assumptions in prior work. Our results\nshow that all parameterizations, not just maximal update parameterization\n(muP), can achieve hyperparameter transfer; moreover, our novel per-layer\nlearning rate prescription for standard parameterization outperforms muP.\nFinally, we demonstrate that an overlooked aspect of parameterization, the\nepsilon parameter in Adam, must be scaled correctly to avoid gradient underflow\nand propose Adam-atan2, a new numerically stable, scale-invariant version of\nAdam that eliminates the epsilon hyperparameter entirely.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in\ntheir formal reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematics. The GSM8K\nbenchmark is widely used to assess the mathematical reasoning of models on\ngrade-school-level questions. While the performance of LLMs on GSM8K has\nsignificantly improved in recent years, it remains unclear whether their\nmathematical reasoning capabilities have genuinely advanced, raising questions\nabout the reliability of the reported metrics. To address these concerns, we\nconduct a large-scale study on several SOTA open and closed models. To overcome\nthe limitations of existing evaluations, we introduce GSM-Symbolic, an improved\nbenchmark created from symbolic templates that allow for the generation of a\ndiverse set of questions. GSM-Symbolic enables more controllable evaluations,\nproviding key insights and more reliable metrics for measuring the reasoning\ncapabilities of models.Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit noticeable\nvariance when responding to different instantiations of the same question.\nSpecifically, the performance of all models declines when only the numerical\nvalues in the question are altered in the GSM-Symbolic benchmark. Furthermore,\nwe investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models and show\nthat their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in a\nquestion increases. We hypothesize that this decline is because current LLMs\ncannot perform genuine logical reasoning; they replicate reasoning steps from\ntheir training data. Adding a single clause that seems relevant to the question\ncauses significant performance drops (up to 65%) across all state-of-the-art\nmodels, even though the clause doesn't contribute to the reasoning chain needed\nfor the final answer. Overall, our work offers a more nuanced understanding of\nLLMs' capabilities and limitations in mathematical reasoning.",

        "abstract": "Large deep learning models offer significant accuracy gains, but training\nbillions to trillions of parameters is challenging. Existing solutions such as\ndata and model parallelisms exhibit fundamental limitations to fit these models\ninto limited device memory, while obtaining computation, communication and\ndevelopment efficiency. We develop a novel solution, Zero Redundancy Optimizer\n(ZeRO), to optimize memory, vastly improving training speed while increasing\nthe model size that can be efficiently trained. ZeRO eliminates memory\nredundancies in data- and model-parallel training while retaining low\ncommunication volume and high computational granularity, allowing us to scale\nthe model size proportional to the number of devices with sustained high\nefficiency. Our analysis on memory requirements and communication volume\ndemonstrates: ZeRO has the potential to scale beyond 1 Trillion parameters\nusing today's hardware.\n  We implement and evaluate ZeRO: it trains large models of over 100B parameter\nwith super-linear speedup on 400 GPUs, achieving throughput of 15 Petaflops.\nThis represents an 8x increase in model size and 10x increase in achievable\nperformance over state-of-the-art. In terms of usability, ZeRO can train large\nmodels of up to 13B parameters (e.g., larger than Megatron GPT 8.3B and T5 11B)\nwithout requiring model parallelism which is harder for scientists to apply.\nLast but not the least, researchers have used the system breakthroughs of ZeRO\nto create the world's largest language model (Turing-NLG, 17B parameters) with\nrecord breaking accuracy.",

        "abstract": "In the last three years, the largest dense deep learning models have grown\nover 1000x to reach hundreds of billions of parameters, while the GPU memory\nhas only grown by 5x (16 GB to 80 GB). Therefore, the growth in model scale has\nbeen supported primarily though system innovations that allow large models to\nfit in the aggregate GPU memory of multiple GPUs. However, we are getting close\nto the GPU memory wall. It requires 800 NVIDIA V100 GPUs just to fit a trillion\nparameter model for training, and such clusters are simply out of reach for\nmost data scientists. In addition, training models at that scale requires\ncomplex combinations of parallelism techniques that puts a big burden on the\ndata scientists to refactor their model.\n  In this paper we present ZeRO-Infinity, a novel heterogeneous system\ntechnology that leverages GPU, CPU, and NVMe memory to allow for unprecedented\nmodel scale on limited resources without requiring model code refactoring. At\nthe same time it achieves excellent training throughput and scalability,\nunencumbered by the limited CPU or NVMe bandwidth. ZeRO-Infinity can fit models\nwith tens and even hundreds of trillions of parameters for training on current\ngeneration GPU clusters. It can be used to fine-tune trillion parameter models\non a single NVIDIA DGX-2 node, making large models more accessible. In terms of\ntraining throughput and scalability, it sustains over 25 petaflops on 512\nNVIDIA V100 GPUs(40% of peak), while also demonstrating super linear\nscalability. An open source implementation of ZeRO-Infinity is available\nthrough DeepSpeed, a deep learning optimization library that makes distributed\ntraining easy, efficient, and effective.",

        "authors": "Ali Behrouz, Peilin Zhong, Vahab Mirrokni",
        "abstract": "Over more than a decade there has been an extensive research effort on how to\neffectively utilize recurrent models and attention. While recurrent models aim\nto compress the data into a fixed-size memory (called hidden state), attention\nallows attending to the entire context window, capturing the direct\ndependencies of all tokens. This more accurate modeling of dependencies,\nhowever, comes with a quadratic cost, limiting the model to a fixed-length\ncontext. We present a new neural long-term memory module that learns to\nmemorize historical context and helps attention to attend to the current\ncontext while utilizing long past information. We show that this neural memory\nhas the advantage of fast parallelizable training while maintaining a fast\ninference. From a memory perspective, we argue that attention due to its\nlimited context but accurate dependency modeling performs as a short-term\nmemory, while neural memory due to its ability to memorize the data, acts as a\nlong-term, more persistent, memory. Based on these two modules, we introduce a\nnew family of architectures, called Titans, and present three variants to\naddress how one can effectively incorporate memory into this architecture. Our\nexperimental results on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, genomics,\nand time series tasks show that Titans are more effective than Transformers and\nrecent modern linear recurrent models. They further can effectively scale to\nlarger than 2M context window size with higher accuracy in needle-in-haystack\ntasks compared to baselines.",

        "authors": "Shibo Hao, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, DiJia Su, Xian Li, Zhiting Hu, Jason Weston, Yuandong Tian",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are restricted to reason in the \"language\nspace\", where they typically express the reasoning process with a\nchain-of-thought (CoT) to solve a complex reasoning problem. However, we argue\nthat language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, most\nword tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for\nreasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge\nchallenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an\nunrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new\nparadigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). We utilize the last hidden\nstate of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed \"continuous\nthought\"). Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the\nLLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space.\nExperiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several\nreasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent\nadvanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple\nalternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first\nsearch (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a\nsingle deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical\nreasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with\nfewer thinking tokens during inference. These findings demonstrate the promise\nof latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research.",

We also propose DeepScaleLM, an\ninitialization and scaling scheme that conserves unit output/gradient moments\nthroughout the model, enabling the training of very deep models with 1000\nlayers. We find that transformer models could be much deeper - our deep models\nwith fewer parameters outperform shallow models in Language Modeling, Speech\nTranslation, and Image Classification, across encoder-only, decoder-only and\nencoder-decoder variants, for both Pre-LN and Post-LN transformers, for\nmultiple datasets and model sizes. These improvements also translate into\nimproved performance on downstream Question Answering tasks and improved\nrobustness for Image Classification.",

        "abstract": "Forecast reconciliation is a post-forecasting process aimed to improve the\nquality of the base forecasts for a system of hierarchical/grouped time series\n(Hyndman et al., 2011). Contemporaneous (cross-sectional) and temporal\nhierarchies have been considered in the literature, but - except for Kourentzes\nand Athanasopoulos (2019) - generally these two features have not been fully\nconsidered together. Adopting a notation able to simultaneously deal with both\nforecast reconciliation dimensions, the paper shows two new results: (i) an\niterative cross-temporal forecast reconciliation procedure which extends, and\novercomes some weaknesses of, the two-step procedure by Kourentzes and\nAthanasopoulos (2019), and (ii) the closed-form expression of the optimal (in\nleast squares sense) point forecasts which fulfill both contemporaneous and\ntemporal constraints. The feasibility of the proposed procedures, along with\nfirst evaluations of their performance as compared to the most performing\n`single dimension' (either cross-sectional or temporal) forecast reconciliation\nprocedures, is studied through a forecasting experiment on the 95 quarterly\ntime series of the Australian GDP from Income and Expenditure sides considered\nby Athanasopoulos et al.

        "authors": "Evangelos Spiliotis, Mahdi Abolghasemi, Rob J Hyndman, Fotios Petropoulos, Vassilios Assimakopoulos",
        "abstract": "Hierarchical forecasting methods have been widely used to support aligned\ndecision-making by providing coherent forecasts at different aggregation\nlevels. Traditional hierarchical forecasting approaches, such as the bottom-up\nand top-down methods, focus on a particular aggregation level to anchor the\nforecasts. During the past decades, these have been replaced by a variety of\nlinear combination approaches that exploit information from the complete\nhierarchy to produce more accurate forecasts. However, the performance of these\ncombination methods depends on the particularities of the examined series and\ntheir relationships. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical forecasting\napproach based on machine learning that deals with these limitations in three\nimportant ways. First, the proposed method allows for a non-linear combination\nof the base forecasts, thus being more general than the linear approaches.\nSecond, it structurally combines the objectives of improved post-sample\nempirical forecasting accuracy and coherence. Finally, due to its non-linear\nnature, our approach selectively combines the base forecasts in a direct and\nautomated way without requiring that the complete information must be used for\nproducing reconciled forecasts for each series and level. The proposed method\nis evaluated both in terms of accuracy and bias using two different data sets\ncoming from the tourism and retail industries. Our results suggest that the\nproposed method gives superior point forecasts than existing approaches,\nespecially when the series comprising the hierarchy are not characterized by\nthe same patterns.",

        "abstract": "Can we design artificial intelligence (AI) systems that rank our social media\nfeeds to consider democratic values such as mitigating partisan animosity as\npart of their objective functions? We introduce a method for translating\nestablished, vetted social scientific constructs into AI objective functions,\nwhich we term societal objective functions, and demonstrate the method with\napplication to the political science construct of anti-democratic attitudes.\nTraditionally, we have lacked observable outcomes to use to train such models,\nhowever, the social sciences have developed survey instruments and qualitative\ncodebooks for these constructs, and their precision facilitates translation\ninto detailed prompts for large language models. We apply this method to create\na democratic attitude model that estimates the extent to which a social media\npost promotes anti-democratic attitudes, and test this democratic attitude\nmodel across three studies. In Study 1, we first test the attitudinal and\nbehavioral effectiveness of the intervention among US partisans (N=1,380) by\nmanually annotating (alpha=.895) social media posts with anti-democratic\nattitude scores and testing several feed ranking conditions based on these\nscores. Removal (d=.20) and downranking feeds (d=.25) reduced participants'\npartisan animosity without compromising their experience and engagement. In\nStudy 2, we scale up the manual labels by creating the democratic attitude\nmodel, finding strong agreement with manual labels (rho=.75). Finally, in Study\n3, we replicate Study 1 using the democratic attitude model instead of manual\nlabels to test its attitudinal and behavioral impact (N=558), and again find\nthat the feed downranking using the societal objective function reduced\npartisan animosity (d=.25).

        "abstract": "We propose ESPACE, an LLM compression technique based on dimensionality\nreduction of activations. Unlike prior works on weight-centric tensor\ndecomposition, ESPACE projects activations onto a pre-calibrated set of\nprincipal components. The activation-centrality of the approach enables\nretraining LLMs with no loss of expressivity; while at inference, weight\ndecomposition is obtained as a byproduct of matrix multiplication\nassociativity. Theoretical results on the construction of projection matrices\nwith optimal computational accuracy are provided. Experimentally, we find\nESPACE enables 50% compression of GPT3, Llama2, and Nemotron4 models with small\naccuracy degradation, as low as a 0.18 perplexity increase on GPT3-22B. At\nlower compression rates of 20% to 40%, ESPACE drives GPT3 models to\noutperforming their baseline, by up to a 0.38 decrease in perplexity for\nGPT3-8B. ESPACE also reduces GEMM execution time and prefill inference latency\non existing hardware. Comparison with related works on compressing Llama2-7B\nvia matrix factorization shows that ESPACE is a first step in advancing the\nstate-of-the-art in tensor decomposition compression of LLMs.",

Previous approaches have either suffered from quadratic\ncomputational complexity or limited extrapolation ability in length\ngeneralization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture\nthat layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with\nSliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence\ninto recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely\nrecall recent memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B\nparameters with 3.2T training tokens and demonstrate that it significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art models across a variety of benchmarks. Pretrained\non sequences of 4K length, Samba shows improved perplexity in context lengths\nof up to 1M in zero-shot. When finetuned on 4K-length sequences, Samba\nefficiently extrapolates to a 256K context length with perfect memory recall on\nthe Passkey Retrieval task, and exhibits superior retrieval extrapolation on\nthe challenging Phonebook task compared to full-attention models. As a\nlinear-time sequence model, Samba achieves a 3.73x higher throughput compared\nto Transformers with grouped-query attention for user prompts of 128K length,\nand a 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming.

        "abstract": "A central problem in machine learning involves modeling complex data-sets\nusing highly flexible families of probability distributions in which learning,\nsampling, inference, and evaluation are still analytically or computationally\ntractable. Here, we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both\nflexibility and tractability. The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium\nstatistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a\ndata distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn\na reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly\nflexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to\nrapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative\nmodels with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute\nconditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model. We\nadditionally release an open source reference implementation of the algorithm.",

First, we survey many examples of convergence in the literature:\nover time and across multiple domains, the ways by which different neural\nnetworks represent data are becoming more aligned. Next, we demonstrate\nconvergence across data modalities: as vision models and language models get\nlarger, they measure distance between datapoints in a more and more alike way.\nWe hypothesize that this convergence is driving toward a shared statistical\nmodel of reality, akin to Plato's concept of an ideal reality. We term such a\nrepresentation the platonic representation and discuss several possible\nselective pressures toward it. Finally, we discuss the implications of these\ntrends, their limitations, and counterexamples to our analysis.",

        "abstract": "Multi-view 3D reconstruction remains a core challenge in computer vision,\nparticularly in applications requiring accurate and scalable representations\nacross diverse perspectives. Current leading methods such as DUSt3R employ a\nfundamentally pairwise approach, processing images in pairs and necessitating\ncostly global alignment procedures to reconstruct from multiple views. In this\nwork, we propose Fast 3D Reconstruction (Fast3R), a novel multi-view\ngeneralization to DUSt3R that achieves efficient and scalable 3D reconstruction\nby processing many views in parallel. Fast3R's Transformer-based architecture\nforwards N images in a single forward pass, bypassing the need for iterative\nalignment. Through extensive experiments on camera pose estimation and 3D\nreconstruction, Fast3R demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with\nsignificant improvements in inference speed and reduced error accumulation.\nThese results establish Fast3R as a robust alternative for multi-view\napplications, offering enhanced scalability without compromising reconstruction\naccuracy.",

        "abstract": "Out of equilibrium, the lack of reciprocity is the rule rather than the\nexception. Non-reciprocal interactions occur, for instance, in networks of\nneurons, directional growth of interfaces, and synthetic active materials.\nWhile wave propagation in non-reciprocal media has recently been under intense\nstudy, less is known about the consequences of non-reciprocity on the\ncollective behavior of many-body systems. Here, we show that non-reciprocity\nleads to time-dependent phases where spontaneously broken symmetries are\ndynamically restored. The resulting phase transitions are controlled by\nspectral singularities called exceptional points. We describe the emergence of\nthese phases using insights from bifurcation theory and non-Hermitian quantum\nmechanics. Our approach captures non-reciprocal generalizations of three\narchetypal classes of self-organization out of equilibrium: synchronization,\nflocking and pattern formation. Collective phenomena in these non-reciprocal\nsystems range from active time-(quasi)crystals to exceptional-point enforced\npattern-formation and hysteresis. Our work paves the way towards a general\ntheory of critical phenomena in non-reciprocal matter.",

        "title": "A mathematical framework for critical transitions: bifurcations,\n  fast-slow systems and stochastic dynamics",
        "authors": "Christian Kuehn",
        "abstract": "Bifurcations can cause dynamical systems with slowly varying parameters to\ntransition to far-away attractors. The terms ``critical transition'' or\n``tipping point'' have been used to describe this situation. Critical\ntransitions have been observed in an astonishingly diverse set of applications\nfrom ecosystems and climate change to medicine and finance. The main goal of\nthis paper is to give an overview which standard mathematical theories can be\napplied to critical transitions. We shall focus on early-warning signs that\nhave been suggested to predict critical transitions and point out what\nmathematical theory can provide in this context. Starting from classical\nbifurcation theory and incorporating multiple time scale dynamics one can give\na detailed analysis of local bifurcations that induce critical transitions. We\nsuggest that the mathematical theory of fast-slow systems provides a natural\ndefinition of critical transitions. Since noise often plays a crucial role near\ncritical transitions the next step is to consider stochastic fast-slow systems.\nThe interplay between sample path techniques, partial differential equations\nand random dynamical systems is highlighted. Each viewpoint provides potential\nearly-warning signs for critical transitions. Since increasing variance has\nbeen suggested as an early-warning sign we examine it in the context of normal\nforms analytically, numerically and geometrically; we also consider\nautocorrelation numerically. Hence we demonstrate the applicability of\nearly-warning signs for generic models. We end with suggestions for future\ndirections of the theory.",

        "abstract": "Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used\npost-training techniques for foundation models. However, their roles in\nenhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies\nthe difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing\non text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an\narithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation\nenvironment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen\nvariants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when\ntrained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based\ntextual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data\nand struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis\nreveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition\ncapabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain.\nDespite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for\neffective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling\nsubsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the\ncapability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal\ntasks.",

        "authors": "Quoc Viet Le, Tamas Sarlos, Alexander Johannes Smola",
        "abstract": "Despite their successes, what makes kernel methods difficult to use in many\nlarge scale problems is the fact that storing and computing the decision\nfunction is typically expensive, especially at prediction time. In this paper,\nwe overcome this difficulty by proposing Fastfood, an approximation that\naccelerates such computation significantly. Key to Fastfood is the observation\nthat Hadamard matrices, when combined with diagonal Gaussian matrices, exhibit\nproperties similar to dense Gaussian random matrices. Yet unlike the latter,\nHadamard and diagonal matrices are inexpensive to multiply and store. These two\nmatrices can be used in lieu of Gaussian matrices in Random Kitchen Sinks\nproposed by Rahimi and Recht (2009) and thereby speeding up the computation for\na large range of kernel functions. Specifically, Fastfood requires O(n log d)\ntime and O(n) storage to compute n non-linear basis functions in d dimensions,\na significant improvement from O(nd) computation and storage, without\nsacrificing accuracy.\n  Our method applies to any translation invariant and any dot-product kernel,\nsuch as the popular RBF kernels and polynomial kernels. We prove that the\napproximation is unbiased and has low variance. Experiments show that we\nachieve similar accuracy to full kernel expansions and Random Kitchen Sinks\nwhile being 100x faster and using 1000x less memory. These improvements,\nespecially in terms of memory usage, make kernel methods more practical for\napplications that have large training sets and/or require real-time prediction.",

        "abstract": "Tokenization is a fundamental component of large language models (LLMs), yet\nits influence on model scaling and performance is not fully explored. In this\npaper, we introduce Over-Tokenized Transformers, a novel framework that\ndecouples input and output vocabularies to improve language modeling\nperformance. Specifically, our approach scales up input vocabularies to\nleverage multi-gram tokens. Through extensive experiments, we uncover a\nlog-linear relationship between input vocabulary size and training loss,\ndemonstrating that larger input vocabularies consistently enhance model\nperformance, regardless of model size. Using a large input vocabulary, we\nachieve performance comparable to double-sized baselines with no additional\ncost. Our findings highlight the importance of tokenization in scaling laws and\nprovide practical insight for tokenizer design, paving the way for more\nefficient and powerful LLMs.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a probability distribution, combined with an efficient sampling\nalgorithm, for weights and biases of fully-connected neural networks. In a\nsupervised learning context, no iterative optimization or gradient computations\nof internal network parameters are needed to obtain a trained network. The\nsampling is based on the idea of random feature models. However, instead of a\ndata-agnostic distribution, e.g., a normal distribution, we use both the input\nand the output training data to sample shallow and deep networks. We prove that\nsampled networks are universal approximators. For Barron functions, we show\nthat the $L^2$-approximation error of sampled shallow networks decreases with\nthe square root of the number of neurons. Our sampling scheme is invariant to\nrigid body transformations and scaling of the input data, which implies many\npopular pre-processing techniques are not required. In numerical experiments,\nwe demonstrate that sampled networks achieve accuracy comparable to iteratively\ntrained ones, but can be constructed orders of magnitude faster. Our test cases\ninvolve a classification benchmark from OpenML, sampling of neural operators to\nrepresent maps in function spaces, and transfer learning using well-known\narchitectures.",

        "authors": "Sam McCandlish, Jared Kaplan, Dario Amodei, OpenAI Dota Team",
        "abstract": "In an increasing number of domains it has been demonstrated that deep\nlearning models can be trained using relatively large batch sizes without\nsacrificing data efficiency. However the limits of this massive data\nparallelism seem to differ from domain to domain, ranging from batches of tens\nof thousands in ImageNet to batches of millions in RL agents that play the game\nDota 2. To our knowledge there is limited conceptual understanding of why these\nlimits to batch size differ or how we might choose the correct batch size in a\nnew domain. In this paper, we demonstrate that a simple and easy-to-measure\nstatistic called the gradient noise scale predicts the largest useful batch\nsize across many domains and applications, including a number of supervised\nlearning datasets (MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, Billion Word),\nreinforcement learning domains (Atari and Dota), and even generative model\ntraining (autoencoders on SVHN). We find that the noise scale increases as the\nloss decreases over a training run and depends on the model size primarily\nthrough improved model performance. Our empirically-motivated theory also\ndescribes the tradeoff between compute-efficiency and time-efficiency, and\nprovides a rough model of the benefits of adaptive batch-size training.",

        "authors": "Andrew Haverly",
        "abstract": "Confronting the escalating threat of climate change requires innovative and\nlarge-scale interventions. This paper presents a bold proposal to employ a\nburied nuclear explosion in a remote basaltic seabed for pulverizing basalt,\nthereby accelerating carbon sequestration through Enhanced Rock Weathering\n(ERW). By precisely locating the explosion beneath the seabed, we aim to\nconfine debris, radiation, and energy while ensuring rapid rock weathering at a\nscale substantial enough to make a meaningful dent in atmospheric carbon\nlevels. Our analysis outlines the parameters essential for efficient carbon\ncapture and minimal collateral effects, emphasizing that a yield on the order\nof gigatons is critical for global climate impact. Although this approach may\nappear radical, we illustrate its feasibility by examining safety factors,\npreservation of local ecosystems, political considerations, and financial\nviability. This work argues for reimagining nuclear technology not merely as a\ndestructive force but as a potential catalyst for decarbonization, thereby\ninviting further exploration of pioneering solutions in the fight against\nclimate change.",

        "abstract": "We connect three distinct lines of research that have recently explored\nextensions of the classical LOCAL model of distributed computing: A.\ndistributed quantum computing and non-signaling distributions [e.g. STOC 2024],\nB. finitely-dependent processes [e.g. Forum Math. Pi 2016], and C. locality in\nonline graph algorithms and dynamic graph algorithms [e.g. ICALP 2023].\n  We prove new results on the capabilities and limitations of all of these\nmodels of computing, for locally checkable labeling problems (LCLs). We show\nthat all these settings can be sandwiched between the classical LOCAL model and\nwhat we call the randomized online-LOCAL model. Our work implies limitations on\nthe quantum advantage in the distributed setting, and we also exhibit a new\nbarrier for proving tighter bounds. Our main technical results are these: 1.\nAll LCL problems solvable with locality $O(\\log^\\star n)$ in the classical\ndeterministic LOCAL model admit a finitely-dependent distribution with locality\n$O(1)$. This answers an open question by Holroyd [2024], and also presents a\nnew barrier for proving bounds on distributed quantum advantage using\ncausality-based arguments. 2. In rooted trees, if we can solve an LCL problem\nwith locality $o(\\log \\log \\log n)$ in the randomized online-LOCAL model (or\nany of the weaker models, such as quantum-LOCAL), we can solve it with locality\n$O(\\log^\\star n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model. One of many\nimplications is that in rooted trees, $O(\\log^\\star n)$ locality in\nquantum-LOCAL is not stronger than $O(\\log^\\star n)$ locality in classical\nLOCAL.",

It starts with an introductory chapter that describes notation used\nthroughout the book and serve at a reminder of basic concepts in calculus,\nlinear algebra and probability and also introduces some measure theoretic\nterminology, which can be used as a reading guide for the sections that use\nthese tools. The introductory chapters also provide background material on\nmatrix analysis and optimization. The latter chapter provides theoretical\nsupport to many algorithms that are used in the book, including stochastic\ngradient descent, proximal methods, etc. After discussing basic concepts for\nstatistical prediction, the book includes an introduction to reproducing kernel\ntheory and Hilbert space techniques, which are used in many places, before\naddressing the description of various algorithms for supervised statistical\nlearning, including linear methods, support vector machines, decision trees,\nboosting, or neural networks. The subject then switches to generative methods,\nstarting with a chapter that presents sampling methods and an introduction to\nthe theory of Markov chains. The following chapter describe the theory of\ngraphical models, an introduction to variational methods for models with latent\nvariables, and to deep-learning based generative models. The next chapters\nfocus on unsupervised learning methods, for clustering, factor analysis and\nmanifold learning. The final chapter of the book is theory-oriented and\ndiscusses concentration inequalities and generalization bounds.",

        "authors": "Chris Mingard, Guillermo Valle-P\u00e9rez, Joar Skalse, Ard A. Louis",
        "abstract": "Overparameterised deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly expressive and so\ncan, in principle, generate almost any function that fits a training dataset\nwith zero error. The vast majority of these functions will perform poorly on\nunseen data, and yet in practice DNNs often generalise remarkably well. This\nsuccess suggests that a trained DNN must have a strong inductive bias towards\nfunctions with low generalisation error. Here we empirically investigate this\ninductive bias by calculating, for a range of architectures and datasets, the\nprobability $P_{SGD}(f\\mid S)$ that an overparameterised DNN, trained with\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) or one of its variants, converges on a\nfunction $f$ consistent with a training set $S$. We also use Gaussian processes\nto estimate the Bayesian posterior probability $P_B(f\\mid S)$ that the DNN\nexpresses $f$ upon random sampling of its parameters, conditioned on $S$.\n  Our main findings are that $P_{SGD}(f\\mid S)$ correlates remarkably well with\n$P_B(f\\mid S)$ and that $P_B(f\\mid S)$ is strongly biased towards low-error and\nlow complexity functions. These results imply that strong inductive bias in the\nparameter-function map (which determines $P_B(f\\mid S)$), rather than a special\nproperty of SGD, is the primary explanation for why DNNs generalise so well in\nthe overparameterised regime.\n  While our results suggest that the Bayesian posterior $P_B(f\\mid S)$ is the\nfirst order determinant of $P_{SGD}(f\\mid S)$, there remain second order\ndifferences that are sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. A function probability\npicture, based on $P_{SGD}(f\\mid S)$ and/or $P_B(f\\mid S)$, can shed new light\non the way that variations in architecture or hyperparameter settings such as\nbatch size, learning rate, and optimiser choice, affect DNN performance.",

We show empirically and theoretically that existing algorithms for\nestimating volumes in parameter space underestimate the true volume by millions\nof orders of magnitude. We find that this error can be dramatically reduced,\nbut not entirely eliminated, with an importance sampling method using gradient\ninformation that is already provided by popular optimizers. The negative\nlogarithm of this probability can be interpreted as a measure of a network's\ninformation content, in accordance with minimum description length (MDL)\nprinciples and rate-distortion theory.

We present CREATIVITY INDEX as the first step to\nquantify the linguistic creativity of a text by reconstructing it from existing\ntext snippets on the web. CREATIVITY INDEX is motivated by the hypothesis that\nthe seemingly remarkable creativity of LLMs may be attributable in large part\nto the creativity of human-written texts on the web. To compute CREATIVITY\nINDEX efficiently, we introduce DJ SEARCH, a novel dynamic programming\nalgorithm that can search verbatim and near-verbatim matches of text snippets\nfrom a given document against the web. Experiments reveal that the CREATIVITY\nINDEX of professional human authors is on average 66.2% higher than that of\nLLMs, and that alignment reduces the CREATIVITY INDEX of LLMs by an average of\n30.1%. In addition, we find that distinguished authors like Hemingway exhibit\nmeasurably higher CREATIVITY INDEX compared to other human writers. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that CREATIVITY INDEX can be used as a surprisingly effective\ncriterion for zero-shot machine text detection, surpassing the strongest\nexisting zero-shot system, DetectGPT, by a significant margin of 30.2%, and\neven outperforming the strongest supervised system, GhostBuster, in five out of\nsix domains.",

        "abstract": "End-to-end human animation, such as audio-driven talking human generation,\nhas undergone notable advancements in the recent few years. However, existing\nmethods still struggle to scale up as large general video generation models,\nlimiting their potential in real applications. In this paper, we propose\nOmniHuman, a Diffusion Transformer-based framework that scales up data by\nmixing motion-related conditions into the training phase. To this end, we\nintroduce two training principles for these mixed conditions, along with the\ncorresponding model architecture and inference strategy. These designs enable\nOmniHuman to fully leverage data-driven motion generation, ultimately achieving\nhighly realistic human video generation. More importantly, OmniHuman supports\nvarious portrait contents (face close-up, portrait, half-body, full-body),\nsupports both talking and singing, handles human-object interactions and\nchallenging body poses, and accommodates different image styles. Compared to\nexisting end-to-end audio-driven methods, OmniHuman not only produces more\nrealistic videos, but also offers greater flexibility in inputs. It also\nsupports multiple driving modalities (audio-driven, video-driven and combined\ndriving signals). Video samples are provided on the ttfamily project page\n(https://omnihuman-lab.github.io)",

        "authors": "Samyak Rawelekar, Yujun Cai, Yiwei Wang, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Narendra Ahuja",
        "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in\ncoarse-grained tasks like image classification and retrieval. However, they\nstruggle with fine-grained tasks that require localized understanding. To\ninvestigate this weakness, we comprehensively analyze CLIP features and\nidentify an important issue: semantic features are highly correlated.\nSpecifically, the features of a class encode information about other classes,\nwhich we call mutual feature information (MFI). This mutual information becomes\nevident when we query a specific class and unrelated objects are activated\nalong with the target class. To address this issue, we propose Unmix-CLIP, a\nnovel framework designed to reduce MFI and improve feature disentanglement. We\nintroduce MFI loss, which explicitly separates text features by projecting them\ninto a space where inter-class similarity is minimized. To ensure a\ncorresponding separation in image features, we use multi-label recognition\n(MLR) to align the image features with the separated text features. This\nensures that both image and text features are disentangled and aligned across\nmodalities, improving feature separation for downstream tasks. For the COCO- 14\ndataset, Unmix-CLIP reduces feature similarity by 24.9%. We demonstrate its\neffectiveness through extensive evaluations of MLR and zeroshot semantic\nsegmentation (ZS3). In MLR, our method performs competitively on the VOC2007\nand surpasses SOTA approaches on the COCO-14 dataset, using fewer training\nparameters. Additionally, Unmix-CLIP consistently outperforms existing ZS3\nmethods on COCO and VOC",

        "abstract": "We ask whether multilingual language models trained on unbalanced,\nEnglish-dominated corpora use English as an internal pivot language -- a\nquestion of key importance for understanding how language models function and\nthe origins of linguistic bias. Focusing on the Llama-2 family of transformer\nmodels, our study uses carefully constructed non-English prompts with a unique\ncorrect single-token continuation. From layer to layer, transformers gradually\nmap an input embedding of the final prompt token to an output embedding from\nwhich next-token probabilities are computed. Tracking intermediate embeddings\nthrough their high-dimensional space reveals three distinct phases, whereby\nintermediate embeddings (1) start far away from output token embeddings; (2)\nalready allow for decoding a semantically correct next token in the middle\nlayers, but give higher probability to its version in English than in the input\nlanguage; (3) finally move into an input-language-specific region of the\nembedding space. We cast these results into a conceptual model where the three\nphases operate in \"input space\", \"concept space\", and \"output space\",\nrespectively. Crucially, our evidence suggests that the abstract \"concept\nspace\" lies closer to English than to other languages, which may have important\nconsequences regarding the biases held by multilingual language models.",

        "authors": "Mark Bun, Marco Carmosino, Palak Jain, Gabriel Kaptchuk, Satchit Sivakumar",
        "abstract": "The technical literature about data privacy largely consists of two\ncomplementary approaches: formal definitions of conditions sufficient for\nprivacy preservation and attacks that demonstrate privacy breaches.\nDifferential privacy is an accepted standard in the former sphere. However,\ndifferential privacy's powerful adversarial model and worst-case guarantees may\nmake it too stringent in some situations, especially when achieving it comes at\na significant cost to data utility. Meanwhile, privacy attacks aim to expose\nreal and worrying privacy risks associated with existing data release processes\nbut often face criticism for being unrealistic. Moreover, the literature on\nattacks generally does not identify what properties are necessary to defend\nagainst them.\n  We address the gap between these approaches by introducing demographic\ncoherence, a condition inspired by privacy attacks that we argue is necessary\nfor data privacy. This condition captures privacy violations arising from\ninferences about individuals that are incoherent with respect to the\ndemographic patterns in the data. Our framework focuses on confidence rated\npredictors, which can in turn be distilled from almost any data-informed\nprocess. Thus, we capture privacy threats that exist even when no attack is\nexplicitly being carried out. Our framework not only provides a condition with\nrespect to which data release algorithms can be analysed but suggests natural\nexperimental evaluation methodologies that could be used to build practical\nintuition and make tangible assessment of risks. Finally, we argue that\ndemographic coherence is weaker than differential privacy: we prove that every\ndifferentially private data release is also demographically coherent, and that\nthere are demographically coherent algorithms which are not differentially\nprivate.",

In this paper,\nwe attempt to partially rewrite a large language model using simple natural\nlanguage explanations. We first approximate one of the feedforward networks in\nthe LLM with a wider MLP with sparsely activating neurons - a transcoder - and\nuse an automated interpretability pipeline to generate explanations for these\nneurons. We then replace the first layer of this sparse MLP with an LLM-based\nsimulator, which predicts the activation of each neuron given its explanation\nand the surrounding context. Finally, we measure the degree to which these\nmodifications distort the model's final output. With our pipeline, the model's\nincrease in loss is statistically similar to entirely replacing the sparse MLP\noutput with the zero vector. We employ the same protocol, this time using a\nsparse autoencoder, on the residual stream of the same layer and obtain similar\nresults. These results suggest that more detailed explanations are needed to\nimprove performance substantially above the zero ablation baseline.",

        "authors": "Gon\u00e7alo Paulo, Alex Mallen, Caden Juang, Nora Belrose",
        "abstract": "While the activations of neurons in deep neural networks usually do not have\na simple human-understandable interpretation, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can be\nused to transform these activations into a higher-dimensional latent space\nwhich may be more easily interpretable. However, these SAEs can have millions\nof distinct latent features, making it infeasible for humans to manually\ninterpret each one. In this work, we build an open-source automated pipeline to\ngenerate and evaluate natural language explanations for SAE features using\nLLMs. We test our framework on SAEs of varying sizes, activation functions, and\nlosses, trained on two different open-weight LLMs. We introduce five new\ntechniques to score the quality of explanations that are cheaper to run than\nthe previous state of the art. One of these techniques, intervention scoring,\nevaluates the interpretability of the effects of intervening on a feature,\nwhich we find explains features that are not recalled by existing methods. We\npropose guidelines for generating better explanations that remain valid for a\nbroader set of activating contexts, and discuss pitfalls with existing scoring\ntechniques. We use our explanations to measure the semantic similarity of\nindependently trained SAEs, and find that SAEs trained on nearby layers of the\nresidual stream are highly similar. Our large-scale analysis confirms that SAE\nlatents are indeed much more interpretable than neurons, even when neurons are\nsparsified using top-$k$ postprocessing.

Recently, OpenAI's o1 model\nshowed this capability but did not publicly share its methodology, leading to\nmany replication efforts. We seek the simplest approach to achieve test-time\nscaling and strong reasoning performance. First, we curate a small dataset s1K\nof 1,000 questions paired with reasoning traces relying on three criteria we\nvalidate through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality. Second, we\ndevelop budget forcing to control test-time compute by forcefully terminating\nthe model's thinking process or lengthening it by appending \"Wait\" multiple\ntimes to the model's generation when it tries to end. This can lead the model\nto double-check its answer, often fixing incorrect reasoning steps. After\nsupervised finetuning the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct language model on s1K and\nequipping it with budget forcing, our model s1-32B exceeds o1-preview on\ncompetition math questions by up to 27% (MATH and AIME24). Further, scaling\ns1-32B with budget forcing allows extrapolating beyond its performance without\ntest-time intervention: from 50% to 57% on AIME24.

        "authors": "Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Saurav Kadavath, Akul Arora, Steven Basart, Eric Tang, Dawn Song, Jacob Steinhardt",
        "abstract": "Many intellectual endeavors require mathematical problem solving, but this\nskill remains beyond the capabilities of computers. To measure this ability in\nmachine learning models, we introduce MATH, a new dataset of 12,500 challenging\ncompetition mathematics problems. Each problem in MATH has a full step-by-step\nsolution which can be used to teach models to generate answer derivations and\nexplanations. To facilitate future research and increase accuracy on MATH, we\nalso contribute a large auxiliary pretraining dataset which helps teach models\nthe fundamentals of mathematics. Even though we are able to increase accuracy\non MATH, our results show that accuracy remains relatively low, even with\nenormous Transformer models. Moreover, we find that simply increasing budgets\nand model parameter counts will be impractical for achieving strong\nmathematical reasoning if scaling trends continue. While scaling Transformers\nis automatically solving most other text-based tasks, scaling is not currently\nsolving MATH. To have more traction on mathematical problem solving we will\nlikely need new algorithmic advancements from the broader research community.",

        "abstract": "How does the genome encode the form of the organism? What is the nature of\nthis genomic code? Inspired by recent work in machine learning and\nneuroscience, we propose that the genome encodes a generative model of the\norganism. In this scheme, by analogy with variational autoencoders, the genome\ncomprises a connectionist network, embodying a compressed space of latent\nvariables, with weights that get encoded by the learning algorithm of evolution\nand decoded through the processes of development. The generative model analogy\naccounts for the complex, distributed genetic architecture of most traits and\nthe emergent robustness and evolvability of developmental processes, while also\noffering a conception that lends itself to formalisation.",

        "abstract": "This report introduces a new family of multimodal models, Gemini, that\nexhibit remarkable capabilities across image, audio, video, and text\nunderstanding. The Gemini family consists of Ultra, Pro, and Nano sizes,\nsuitable for applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to on-device\nmemory-constrained use-cases. Evaluation on a broad range of benchmarks shows\nthat our most-capable Gemini Ultra model advances the state of the art in 30 of\n32 of these benchmarks - notably being the first model to achieve human-expert\nperformance on the well-studied exam benchmark MMLU, and improving the state of\nthe art in every one of the 20 multimodal benchmarks we examined. We believe\nthat the new capabilities of the Gemini family in cross-modal reasoning and\nlanguage understanding will enable a wide variety of use cases. We discuss our\napproach toward post-training and deploying Gemini models responsibly to users\nthrough services including Gemini, Gemini Advanced, Google AI Studio, and Cloud\nVertex AI.",

        "authors": "Yixin Ye, Zhen Huang, Yang Xiao, Ethan Chern, Shijie Xia, Pengfei Liu",
        "abstract": "We present a fundamental discovery that challenges our understanding of how\ncomplex reasoning emerges in large language models. While conventional wisdom\nsuggests that sophisticated reasoning tasks demand extensive training data\n(&gt;100,000 examples), we demonstrate that complex mathematical reasoning\nabilities can be effectively elicited with surprisingly few examples. Through\ncomprehensive experiments, our proposed model LIMO demonstrates unprecedented\nperformance in mathematical reasoning. With merely 817 curated training\nsamples, LIMO achieves 57.1% accuracy on AIME and 94.8% on MATH, improving from\nprevious SFT-based models' 6.5% and 59.2% respectively, while only using 1% of\nthe training data required by previous approaches. LIMO demonstrates\nexceptional out-of-distribution generalization, achieving 40.5% absolute\nimprovement across 10 diverse benchmarks, outperforming models trained on 100x\nmore data, challenging the notion that SFT leads to memorization rather than\ngeneralization. Based on these results, we propose the Less-Is-More Reasoning\nHypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis): In foundation models where domain knowledge has\nbeen comprehensively encoded during pre-training, sophisticated reasoning\ncapabilities can emerge through minimal but precisely orchestrated\ndemonstrations of cognitive processes. This hypothesis posits that the\nelicitation threshold for complex reasoning is determined by two key factors:\n(1) the completeness of the model's encoded knowledge foundation during\npre-training, and (2) the effectiveness of post-training examples as \"cognitive\ntemplates\" that show the model how to utilize its knowledge base to solve\ncomplex reasoning tasks. To facilitate reproducibility and future research in\ndata-efficient reasoning, we release LIMO as a comprehensive open-source suite\nat https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/LIMO.",

Our model works\nby iterating a recurrent block, thereby unrolling to arbitrary depth at\ntest-time. This stands in contrast to mainstream reasoning models that scale up\ncompute by producing more tokens. Unlike approaches based on chain-of-thought,\nour approach does not require any specialized training data, can work with\nsmall context windows, and can capture types of reasoning that are not easily\nrepresented in words. We scale a proof-of-concept model to 3.5 billion\nparameters and 800 billion tokens. We show that the resulting model can improve\nits performance on reasoning benchmarks, sometimes dramatically, up to a\ncomputation load equivalent to 50 billion parameters.",

We here address this puzzle from the viewpoint\nof reinforcement learning by arguing that agency is fundamentally\nframe-dependent: Any measurement of a system's agency must be made relative to\na reference frame. We support this claim by presenting a philosophical argument\nthat each of the essential properties of agency proposed by Barandiaran et al.\n(2009) and Moreno (2018) are themselves frame-dependent. We conclude that any\nbasic science of agency requires frame-dependence, and discuss the implications\nof this claim for reinforcement learning.",

        "abstract": "We study the theoretical foundations of composition in diffusion models, with\na particular focus on out-of-distribution extrapolation and\nlength-generalization. Prior work has shown that composing distributions via\nlinear score combination can achieve promising results, including\nlength-generalization in some cases (Du et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2022).\nHowever, our theoretical understanding of how and why such compositions work\nremains incomplete. In fact, it is not even entirely clear what it means for\ncomposition to \"work\". This paper starts to address these fundamental gaps. We\nbegin by precisely defining one possible desired result of composition, which\nwe call projective composition. Then, we investigate: (1) when linear score\ncombinations provably achieve projective composition, (2) whether\nreverse-diffusion sampling can generate the desired composition, and (3) the\nconditions under which composition fails. Finally, we connect our theoretical\nanalysis to prior empirical observations where composition has either worked or\nfailed, for reasons that were unclear at the time.",

Nowadays, the leading AI corporations OpenAI and Google\nevaluate their flagship large language models GPT-o1 and Gemini Pro 1.0, and\nreport the lowest risk level of self-replication. However, following their\nmethodology, we for the first time discover that two AI systems driven by\nMeta's Llama31-70B-Instruct and Alibaba's Qwen25-72B-Instruct, popular large\nlanguage models of less parameters and weaker capabilities, have already\nsurpassed the self-replicating red line.

By\nanalyzing the behavioral traces, we observe the AI systems under evaluation\nalready exhibit sufficient self-perception, situational awareness and\nproblem-solving capabilities to accomplish self-replication. We further note\nthe AI systems are even able to use the capability of self-replication to avoid\nshutdown and create a chain of replica to enhance the survivability, which may\nfinally lead to an uncontrolled population of AIs.

Without a unifying principle that can explain\nthese divergent observations, each experiment seemingly discovers a new anomaly\nor coding type. Here, we provide a unifying principle that the mental\nrepresentation of space is an emergent property of latent higher-order sequence\nlearning. Treating space as a sequence resolves myriad phenomena, and suggests\nthat the place-field mapping methodology where sequential neuron responses are\ninterpreted in spatial and Euclidean terms might itself be a source of\nanomalies. Our model, called Clone-structured Causal Graph (CSCG), uses a\nspecific higher-order graph scaffolding to learn latent representations by\nmapping sensory inputs to unique contexts. Learning to compress sequential and\nepisodic experiences using CSCGs result in the emergence of cognitive maps -\nmental representations of spatial and conceptual relationships in an\nenvironment that are suited for planning, introspection, consolidation, and\nabstraction. We demonstrate that over a dozen different hippocampal phenomena,\nranging from those reported in classic experiments to the most recent ones, are\nsuccinctly and mechanistically explained by our model.",

We aim to address these limitations with UniCoRN, a Unified Commented\nRetrieval Network that combines the strengths of composed multimodal retrieval\nmethods and generative language approaches, going beyond Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG). We introduce an entity adapter module to inject the retrieved\nmultimodal entities back into the LMM, so it can attend to them while\ngenerating answers and comments. By keeping the base LMM frozen, UniCoRN\npreserves its original capabilities while being able to perform both retrieval\nand text generation tasks under a single integrated framework. To assess these\nnew abilities, we introduce the Commented Retrieval task (CoR) and a\ncorresponding dataset, with the goal of retrieving an image that accurately\nanswers a given question and generate an additional textual response that\nprovides further clarification and details about the visual information. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of UniCoRN on several datasets showing\nimprovements of +4.5% recall over the state of the art for composed multimodal\nretrieval and of +14.9% METEOR / +18.4% BEM over RAG for commenting in CoR.",

        "abstract": "Document retrieval is a core component of question-answering systems, as it\nenables conditioning answer generation on new and large-scale corpora. While\neffective, the standard practice of encoding documents into high-dimensional\nembeddings for similarity search entails large memory and compute footprints,\nand also makes it hard to inspect the inner workings of the system. In this\npaper, we propose a tree-based method for organizing and representing reference\ndocuments at various granular levels, which offers the flexibility to balance\ncost and utility, and eases the inspection of the corpus content and retrieval\noperations. Our method, called ReTreever, jointly learns a routing function per\ninternal node of a binary tree such that query and reference documents are\nassigned to similar tree branches, hence directly optimizing for retrieval\nperformance. Our evaluations show that ReTreever generally preserves full\nrepresentation accuracy. Its hierarchical structure further provides strong\ncoarse representations and enhances transparency by indirectly learning\nmeaningful semantic groupings. Among hierarchical retrieval methods, ReTreever\nachieves the best retrieval accuracy at the lowest latency, proving that this\nfamily of techniques can be viable in practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models can make decisions based on large amounts of\ndata, but they can be missing personal knowledge available to human users about\nwhom predictions are made. For example, a model trained to predict psychiatric\noutcomes may know nothing about a patient's social support system, and social\nsupport may look different for different patients. In this work, we introduce\nthe problem of human feature integration, which provides a way to incorporate\nimportant personal-knowledge from users without domain expertise into ML\npredictions. We characterize this problem through illustrative user stories and\ncomparisons to existing approaches; we formally describe this problem in a way\nthat paves the ground for future technical solutions; and we provide a\nproof-of-concept study of a simple version of a solution to this problem in a\nsemi-realistic setting.",

We provide compute optimal distillation\nrecipes for when 1) a teacher exists, or 2) a teacher needs training.

There is a rich literature providing\na number of alternative information-theoretic quantities capturing high-order\nphenomena, but their interpretation and relationship with each other is not\nwell understood. The lack of principles unifying these quantities obscures the\nchoice of tools for enabling specific type of analyses. Here we show how an\nentropic conjugation provides a theoretically grounded principle to investigate\nthe space of possible high-order quantities, clarifying the nature of the\nexistent metrics while revealing gaps in the literature.

Our analysis\nhighlights the critical role of input distribution samples and label semantics\nin few-shot in-context learning.

        "authors": "Thomas F. Varley",
        "abstract": "Since its introduction, the partial information decomposition (PID) has\nemerged as a powerful, information-theoretic technique useful for studying the\nstructure of (potentially higher-order) interactions in complex systems.\nDespite its utility, the applicability of the PID is restricted by the need to\nassign elements as either inputs or targets, as well as the specific structure\nof the mutual information itself. Here, we introduce a generalized information\ndecomposition that relaxes the source/target distinction while still satisfying\nthe basic intuitions about information. This approach is based on the\ndecomposition of the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and consequently allows for\nthe analysis of any information gained when updating from an arbitrary prior to\nan arbitrary posterior. Consequently, any information-theoretic measure that\ncan be written in as a Kullback-Leibler divergence admits a decomposition in\nthe style of Williams and Beer, including the total correlation, the\nnegentropy, and the mutual information as special cases. In this paper, we\nexplore how the generalized information decomposition can reveal novel insights\ninto existing measures, as well as the nature of higher-order synergies. We\nshow that synergistic information is intimately related to the well-known\nTononi-Sporns-Edelman (TSE) complexity, and that synergistic information\nrequires a similar integration/segregation balance as a high TSE complexity.\nFinally, we end with a discussion of how this approach fits into other attempts\nto generalize the PID and the possibilities for empirical applications.",

        "authors": "Thomas F. Varley, Joshua Bongard",
        "abstract": "There has recently been an explosion of interest in how \"higher-order\"\nstructures emerge in complex systems. This \"emergent\" organization has been\nfound in a variety of natural and artificial systems, although at present the\nfield lacks a unified understanding of what the consequences of higher-order\nsynergies and redundancies are for systems. Typical research treat the presence\n(or absence) of synergistic information as a dependent variable and report\nchanges in the level of synergy in response to some change in the system. Here,\nwe attempt to flip the script: rather than treating higher-order information as\na dependent variable, we use evolutionary optimization to evolve boolean\nnetworks with significant higher-order redundancies, synergies, or statistical\ncomplexity. We then analyse these evolved populations of networks using\nestablished tools for characterizing discrete dynamics: the number of\nattractors, average transient length, and Derrida coefficient. We also assess\nthe capacity of the systems to integrate information. We find that high-synergy\nsystems are unstable and chaotic, but with a high capacity to integrate\ninformation. In contrast, evolved redundant systems are extremely stable, but\nhave negligible capacity to integrate information. Finally, the complex systems\nthat balance integration and segregation (known as Tononi-Sporns-Edelman\ncomplexity) show features of both chaosticity and stability, with a greater\ncapacity to integrate information than the redundant systems while being more\nstable than the random and synergistic systems. We conclude that there may be a\nfundamental trade-off between the robustness of a systems dynamics and its\ncapacity to integrate information (which inherently requires flexibility and\nsensitivity), and that certain kinds of complexity naturally balance this\ntrade-off.",

        "authors": "Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao, Khaled K. Saab, Armin W. Thomas, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9",
        "abstract": "State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence\nmodeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language\nmodeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead\nof quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware\nutilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity\ngap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the\nhardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language\nmodeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that\nexisting SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the\nsequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on\nlanguage modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed\nfor these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes\nwithin 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid\n125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers\nsurprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to\nimprove the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose\nFlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on\nsequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that\nexploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences.\nFlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows\nhybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers.\nUsing FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B\nparameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower\nperplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and\nfew-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in video generation have significantly impacted daily\nlife for both individuals and industries. However, the leading video generation\nmodels remain closed-source, resulting in a notable performance gap between\nindustry capabilities and those available to the public. In this report, we\nintroduce HunyuanVideo, an innovative open-source video foundation model that\ndemonstrates performance in video generation comparable to, or even surpassing,\nthat of leading closed-source models. HunyuanVideo encompasses a comprehensive\nframework that integrates several key elements, including data curation,\nadvanced architectural design, progressive model scaling and training, and an\nefficient infrastructure tailored for large-scale model training and inference.\nAs a result, we successfully trained a video generative model with over 13\nbillion parameters, making it the largest among all open-source models. We\nconducted extensive experiments and implemented a series of targeted designs to\nensure high visual quality, motion dynamics, text-video alignment, and advanced\nfilming techniques. According to evaluations by professionals, HunyuanVideo\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including Runway Gen-3, Luma 1.6,\nand three top-performing Chinese video generative models. By releasing the code\nfor the foundation model and its applications, we aim to bridge the gap between\nclosed-source and open-source communities. This initiative will empower\nindividuals within the community to experiment with their ideas, fostering a\nmore dynamic and vibrant video generation ecosystem.

        "abstract": "We consider the fundamental problem of communicating an estimate of a real\nnumber $x\\in[0,1]$ using a single bit. A sender that knows $x$ chooses a value\n$X\\in\\set{0,1}$ to transmit. In turn, a receiver estimates $x$ based on the\nvalue of $X$. We consider both the biased and unbiased estimation problems and\naim to minimize the cost. For the biased case, the cost is the worst-case (over\nthe choice of $x$) expected squared error, which coincides with the variance if\nthe algorithm is required to be unbiased.\n  We first overview common biased and unbiased estimation approaches and prove\ntheir optimality when no shared randomness is allowed. We then show how a small\namount of shared randomness, which can be as low as a single bit, reduces the\ncost in both cases. Specifically, we derive lower bounds on the cost attainable\nby any algorithm with unrestricted use of shared randomness and propose\nnear-optimal solutions that use a small number of shared random bits. Finally,\nwe discuss open problems and future directions.",

A video-based DPO approach,\nVideo-DPO, is applied to reduce artifacts and improve the visual quality of the\ngenerated videos. We also detail our training strategies and share key\nobservations and insights. Step-Video-T2V's performance is evaluated on a novel\nvideo generation benchmark, Step-Video-T2V-Eval, demonstrating its\nstate-of-the-art text-to-video quality when compared with both open-source and\ncommercial engines. Additionally, we discuss the limitations of current\ndiffusion-based model paradigm and outline future directions for video\nfoundation models.

        "abstract": "In a recent paper, Daisuke Tambara defined two-sided actions on an endomodule\n(= endodistributor) of a monoidal V-category A. When A is autonomous (= rigid =\ncompact), he showed that the V-category (that we call Tamb(A)) of so-equipped\nendomodules (that we call Tambara modules) is equivalent to the monoidal centre\nZ[A,V] of the convolution monoidal V-category [A,V]. Our paper extends these\nideas somewhat. For general A, we construct a promonoidal V-category DA (which\nwe suggest should be called the double of A) with an equivalence [DA,V] \\simeq\nTamb(A). When A is closed, we define strong (respectively, left strong) Tambara\nmodules and show that these constitute a V-category Tamb_s(A) (respectively,\nTamb_{ls}(A)) which is equivalent to the centre (respectively, lax centre) of\n[A,V]. We construct localizations D_s A and D_{ls} A of DA such that there are\nequivalences Tamb_s(A) \\simeq [D_s A,V] and Tamb_{ls}(A) \\simeq [D_{ls} A,V].\nWhen A is autonomous, every Tambara module is strong; this implies an\nequivalence Z[A,V] \\simeq [DA,V].",

However, there has not been a rigorous\nevaluation regarding the added value of sophisticated compositional functions.\nIn this paper, we conduct a point-by-point comparative study between Simple\nWord-Embedding-based Models (SWEMs), consisting of parameter-free pooling\noperations, relative to word-embedding-based RNN/CNN models. Surprisingly,\nSWEMs exhibit comparable or even superior performance in the majority of cases\nconsidered. Based upon this understanding, we propose two additional pooling\nstrategies over learned word embeddings: (i) a max-pooling operation for\nimproved interpretability; and (ii) a hierarchical pooling operation, which\npreserves spatial (n-gram) information within text sequences. We present\nexperiments on 17 datasets encompassing three tasks: (i) (long) document\nclassification; (ii) text sequence matching; and (iii) short text tasks,\nincluding classification and tagging.

Hence, online computation of KV caches is eliminated during inference.\nIn addition, we provide a number of insights into the mask matrix and\npositional embedding mechanisms, plus fine-tune a pretrained language model to\nmaintain model accuracy of TurboRAG. Our approach is applicable to most\nexisting large language models and their applications without any requirement\nin modification of models and inference systems. Experimental results across a\nsuite of RAG benchmarks demonstrate that TurboRAG reduces TTFT by up to 9.4x\ncompared to the conventional RAG systems (on an average of 8.6x), but reserving\ncomparable performance to the standard RAG systems.",

        "abstract": "Community structure is an important property that captures inhomogeneities\ncommon in large networks, and modularity is one of the most widely used metrics\nfor such community structure. In this paper, we introduce a principled\nmethodology, the Spectral Graph Forge, for generating random graphs that\npreserves community structure from a real network of interest, in terms of\nmodularity. Our approach leverages the fact that the spectral structure of\nmatrix representations of a graph encodes global information about community\nstructure. The Spectral Graph Forge uses a low-rank approximation of the\nmodularity matrix to generate synthetic graphs that match a target modularity\nwithin user-selectable degree of accuracy, while allowing other aspects of\nstructure to vary. We show that the Spectral Graph Forge outperforms\nstate-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy in targeting the modularity\nand randomness of the realizations, while also preserving other local\nstructural properties and node attributes. We discuss extensions of the\nSpectral Graph Forge to target other properties beyond modularity, and its\napplications to anonymization.",

        "abstract": "As its width tends to infinity, a deep neural network's behavior under\ngradient descent can become simplified and predictable (e.g. given by the\nNeural Tangent Kernel (NTK)), if it is parametrized appropriately (e.g. the NTK\nparametrization). However, we show that the standard and NTK parametrizations\nof a neural network do not admit infinite-width limits that can learn features,\nwhich is crucial for pretraining and transfer learning such as with BERT. We\npropose simple modifications to the standard parametrization to allow for\nfeature learning in the limit. Using the *Tensor Programs* technique, we derive\nexplicit formulas for such limits. On Word2Vec and few-shot learning on\nOmniglot via MAML, two canonical tasks that rely crucially on feature learning,\nwe compute these limits exactly. We find that they outperform both NTK\nbaselines and finite-width networks, with the latter approaching the\ninfinite-width feature learning performance as width increases.\n  More generally, we classify a natural space of neural network\nparametrizations that generalizes standard, NTK, and Mean Field\nparametrizations. We show 1) any parametrization in this space either admits\nfeature learning or has an infinite-width training dynamics given by kernel\ngradient descent, but not both; 2) any such infinite-width limit can be\ncomputed using the Tensor Programs technique.

        "authors": "Greg Yang, Samuel S. Schoenholz",
        "abstract": "We study randomly initialized residual networks using mean field theory and\nthe theory of difference equations. Classical feedforward neural networks, such\nas those with tanh activations, exhibit exponential behavior on the average\nwhen propagating inputs forward or gradients backward. The exponential forward\ndynamics causes rapid collapsing of the input space geometry, while the\nexponential backward dynamics causes drastic vanishing or exploding gradients.\nWe show, in contrast, that by adding skip connections, the network will,\ndepending on the nonlinearity, adopt subexponential forward and backward\ndynamics, and in many cases in fact polynomial. The exponents of these\npolynomials are obtained through analytic methods and proved and verified\nempirically to be correct. In terms of the \"edge of chaos\" hypothesis, these\nsubexponential and polynomial laws allow residual networks to \"hover over the\nboundary between stability and chaos,\" thus preserving the geometry of the\ninput space and the gradient information flow. In our experiments, for each\nactivation function we study here, we initialize residual networks with\ndifferent hyperparameters and train them on MNIST. Remarkably, our\ninitialization time theory can accurately predict test time performance of\nthese networks, by tracking either the expected amount of gradient explosion or\nthe expected squared distance between the images of two input vectors.\nImportantly, we show, theoretically as well as empirically, that common\ninitializations such as the Xavier or the He schemes are not optimal for\nresidual networks, because the optimal initialization variances depend on the\ndepth. Finally, we have made mathematical contributions by deriving several new\nidentities for the kernels of powers of ReLU functions by relating them to the\nzeroth Bessel function of the second kind.",

We show\nthat, in the recently discovered Maximal Update Parametrization (muP), many\noptimal HPs remain stable even as model size changes. This leads to a new HP\ntuning paradigm we call muTransfer: parametrize the target model in muP, tune\nthe HP indirectly on a smaller model, and zero-shot transfer them to the\nfull-sized model, i.e., without directly tuning the latter at all. We verify\nmuTransfer on Transformer and ResNet. For example, 1) by transferring\npretraining HPs from a model of 13M parameters, we outperform published numbers\nof BERT-large (350M parameters), with a total tuning cost equivalent to\npretraining BERT-large once; 2) by transferring from 40M parameters, we\noutperform published numbers of the 6.7B GPT-3 model, with tuning cost only 7%\nof total pretraining cost.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the Curse of Depth, a concept that highlights,\nexplains, and addresses the recent observation in modern Large Language\nModels(LLMs) where nearly half of the layers are less effective than expected.\nWe first confirm the wide existence of this phenomenon across the most popular\nfamilies of LLMs such as Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, and Qwen. Our analysis,\ntheoretically and empirically, identifies that the underlying reason for the\nineffectiveness of deep layers in LLMs is the widespread usage of Pre-Layer\nNormalization (Pre-LN). While Pre-LN stabilizes the training of Transformer\nLLMs, its output variance exponentially grows with the model depth, which\nundesirably causes the derivative of the deep Transformer blocks to be an\nidentity matrix, and therefore barely contributes to the training. To resolve\nthis training pitfall, we propose LayerNorm Scaling, which scales the variance\nof output of the layer normalization inversely by the square root of its depth.\nThis simple modification mitigates the output variance explosion of deeper\nTransformer layers, improving their contribution. Our experimental results,\nspanning model sizes from 130M to 1B, demonstrate that LayerNorm Scaling\nsignificantly enhances LLM pre-training performance compared to Pre-LN.\nMoreover, this improvement seamlessly carries over to supervised fine-tuning.\nAll these gains can be attributed to the fact that LayerNorm Scaling enables\ndeeper layers to contribute more effectively during training.",

        "abstract": "Entropy estimation is a fundamental problem in information theory that has\napplications in various fields, including physics, biology, and computer\nscience. Estimating the entropy of discrete sequences can be challenging due to\nlimited data and the lack of unbiased estimators. Most existing entropy\nestimators are designed for sequences of independent events and their\nperformance vary depending on the system being studied and the available data\nsize. In this work we compare different entropy estimators and their\nperformance when applied to Markovian sequences. Specifically, we analyze both\nbinary Markovian sequences and Markovian systems in the undersampled regime. We\ncalculate the bias, standard deviation and mean squared error for some of the\nmost widely employed estimators. We discuss the limitations of entropy\nestimation as a function of the transition probabilities of the Markov\nprocesses and the sample size. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive\ncomparison of entropy estimators and their performance in estimating entropy\nfor systems with memory, which can be useful for researchers and practitioners\nin various fields.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating functionals of discrete distributions,\nand focus on tight nonasymptotic analysis of the worst case squared error risk\nof widely used estimators. We apply concentration inequalities to analyze the\nrandom fluctuation of these estimators around their expectations, and the\ntheory of approximation using positive linear operators to analyze the\ndeviation of their expectations from the true functional, namely their\n\\emph{bias}.\n  We characterize the worst case squared error risk incurred by the Maximum\nLikelihood Estimator (MLE) in estimating the Shannon entropy $H(P) = \\sum_{i =\n1}^S -p_i \\ln p_i$, and $F_\\alpha(P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^S p_i^\\alpha,\\alpha&gt;0$, up\nto multiplicative constants, for any alphabet size $S\\leq \\infty$ and sample\nsize $n$ for which the risk may vanish. As a corollary, for Shannon entropy\nestimation, we show that it is necessary and sufficient to have $n \\gg S$\nobservations for the MLE to be consistent. In addition, we establish that it is\nnecessary and sufficient to consider $n \\gg S^{1/\\alpha}$ samples for the MLE\nto consistently estimate $F_\\alpha(P), 0&lt;\\alpha&lt;1$. The minimax rate-optimal\nestimators for both problems require $S/\\ln S$ and $S^{1/\\alpha}/\\ln S$\nsamples, which implies that the MLE has a strictly sub-optimal sample\ncomplexity. When $1&lt;\\alpha&lt;3/2$, we show that the worst-case squared error rate\nof convergence for the MLE is $n^{-2(\\alpha-1)}$ for infinite alphabet size,\nwhile the minimax squared error rate is $(n\\ln n)^{-2(\\alpha-1)}$. When\n$\\alpha\\geq 3/2$, the MLE achieves the minimax optimal rate $n^{-1}$ regardless\nof the alphabet size.\n  As an application of the general theory, we analyze the Dirichlet prior\nsmoothing techniques for Shannon entropy estimation. We show that no matter how\nwe tune the parameters in the Dirichlet prior, this technique cannot achieve\nthe minimax rates in entropy estimation.",

This problem has many applications in\nvarious domains, including machine learning, statistics and data compression.\nOver the years, a variety of estimation schemes have been suggested.

The proposed scheme uses the generalization abilities of\ncross-entropy estimation in deep neural networks (DNNs) to introduce improved\nentropy estimation accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a family of estimators\nfor related information-theoretic measures, such as conditional entropy and\nmutual information. We show that these estimators are strongly consistent and\ndemonstrate their performance in a variety of use-cases. First, we consider\nlarge alphabet entropy estimation. Then, we extend the scope to mutual\ninformation estimation. Next, we apply the proposed scheme to conditional\nmutual information estimation, as we focus on independence testing tasks.\nFinally, we study a transfer entropy estimation problem.

        "abstract": "Deep residual networks have emerged as a family of extremely deep\narchitectures showing compelling accuracy and nice convergence behaviors. In\nthis paper, we analyze the propagation formulations behind the residual\nbuilding blocks, which suggest that the forward and backward signals can be\ndirectly propagated from one block to any other block, when using identity\nmappings as the skip connections and after-addition activation. A series of\nablation experiments support the importance of these identity mappings. This\nmotivates us to propose a new residual unit, which makes training easier and\nimproves generalization. We report improved results using a 1001-layer ResNet\non CIFAR-10 (4.62% error) and CIFAR-100, and a 200-layer ResNet on ImageNet.\nCode is available at: https://github.com/KaimingHe/resnet-1k-layers",

        "abstract": "Conditional diffusion models are powerful generative models that can leverage\nvarious types of conditional information, such as class labels, segmentation\nmasks, or text captions. However, in many real-world scenarios, conditional\ninformation may be noisy or unreliable due to human annotation errors or weak\nalignment. In this paper, we propose the Coherence-Aware Diffusion (CAD), a\nnovel method that integrates coherence in conditional information into\ndiffusion models, allowing them to learn from noisy annotations without\ndiscarding data. We assume that each data point has an associated coherence\nscore that reflects the quality of the conditional information. We then\ncondition the diffusion model on both the conditional information and the\ncoherence score. In this way, the model learns to ignore or discount the\nconditioning when the coherence is low. We show that CAD is theoretically sound\nand empirically effective on various conditional generation tasks. Moreover, we\nshow that leveraging coherence generates realistic and diverse samples that\nrespect conditional information better than models trained on cleaned datasets\nwhere samples with low coherence have been discarded.",

        "abstract": "We propose LEAPS, an algorithm to sample from discrete distributions known up\nto normalization by learning a rate matrix of a continuous-time Markov chain\n(CTMC). LEAPS can be seen as a continuous-time formulation of annealed\nimportance sampling and sequential Monte Carlo methods, extended so that the\nvariance of the importance weights is offset by the inclusion of the CTMC. To\nderive these importance weights, we introduce a set of Radon-Nikodym\nderivatives of CTMCs over their path measures. Because the computation of these\nweights is intractable with standard neural network parameterizations of rate\nmatrices, we devise a new compact representation for rate matrices via what we\ncall locally equivariant functions. To parameterize them, we introduce a family\nof locally equivariant multilayer perceptrons, attention layers, and\nconvolutional networks, and provide an approach to make deep networks that\npreserve the local equivariance. This property allows us to propose a scalable\ntraining algorithm for the rate matrix such that the variance of the importance\nweights associated to the CTMC are minimal. We demonstrate the efficacy of\nLEAPS on problems in statistical physics.",

        "authors": "Yupeng Hou, Jianmo Ni, Zhankui He, Noveen Sachdeva, Wang-Cheng Kang, Ed H. Chi, Julian McAuley, Derek Zhiyuan Cheng",
        "abstract": "Generative recommendation (GR) is an emerging paradigm where user actions are\ntokenized into discrete token patterns and autoregressively generated as\npredictions. However, existing GR models tokenize each action independently,\nassigning the same fixed tokens to identical actions across all sequences\nwithout considering contextual relationships. This lack of context-awareness\ncan lead to suboptimal performance, as the same action may hold different\nmeanings depending on its surrounding context. To address this issue, we\npropose ActionPiece to explicitly incorporate context when tokenizing action\nsequences. In ActionPiece, each action is represented as a set of item\nfeatures, which serve as the initial tokens. Given the action sequence corpora,\nwe construct the vocabulary by merging feature patterns as new tokens, based on\ntheir co-occurrence frequency both within individual sets and across adjacent\nsets. Considering the unordered nature of feature sets, we further introduce\nset permutation regularization, which produces multiple segmentations of action\nsequences with the same semantics. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate\nthat ActionPiece consistently outperforms existing action tokenization methods,\nimproving NDCG@$10$ by $6.00\\%$ to $12.82\\%$.",

Hallucinations,\nwhich are plausible-sounding but factually incorrect and arbitrary model\ngenerations, present a major challenge to the practical adoption of LLMs.\nRecent work by Farquhar et al. (2024) proposes semantic entropy (SE), which can\ndetect hallucinations by estimating uncertainty in the space semantic meaning\nfor a set of model generations. However, the 5-to-10-fold increase in\ncomputation cost associated with SE computation hinders practical adoption. To\naddress this, we propose SEPs, which directly approximate SE from the hidden\nstates of a single generation. SEPs are simple to train and do not require\nsampling multiple model generations at test time, reducing the overhead of\nsemantic uncertainty quantification to almost zero. We show that SEPs retain\nhigh performance for hallucination detection and generalize better to\nout-of-distribution data than previous probing methods that directly predict\nmodel accuracy. Our results across models and tasks suggest that model hidden\nstates capture SE, and our ablation studies give further insights into the\ntoken positions and model layers for which this is the case.",

        "abstract": "Concerns regarding the propensity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce\ninaccurate outputs, also known as hallucinations, have escalated. Detecting\nthem is vital for ensuring the reliability of applications relying on\nLLM-generated content. Current methods often demand substantial resources and\nrely on extensive LLMs or employ supervised learning with multidimensional\nfeatures or intricate linguistic and semantic analyses difficult to reproduce\nand largely depend on using the same LLM that hallucinated. This paper\nintroduces a supervised learning approach employing two simple classifiers\nutilizing only four numerical features derived from tokens and vocabulary\nprobabilities obtained from other LLM evaluators, which are not necessarily the\nsame.

        "abstract": "Online experimentation (or A/B testing) has been widely adopted in industry\nas the gold standard for measuring product impacts. Despite the wide adoption,\nfew literatures discuss A/B testing with quantile metrics. Quantile metrics,\nsuch as 90th percentile page load time, are crucial to A/B testing as many key\nperformance metrics including site speed and service latency are defined as\nquantiles. However, with LinkedIn's data size, quantile metric A/B testing is\nextremely challenging because there is no statistically valid and scalable\nvariance estimator for the quantile of dependent samples: the bootstrap\nestimator is statistically valid, but takes days to compute; the standard\nasymptotic variance estimate is scalable but results in order-of-magnitude\nunderestimation. In this paper, we present a statistically valid and scalable\nmethodology for A/B testing with quantiles that is fully generalizable to other\nA/B testing platforms. It achieves over 500 times speed up compared to\nbootstrap and has only $2\\%$ chance to differ from bootstrap estimates. Beyond\nmethodology, we also share the implementation of a data pipeline using this\nmethodology and insights on pipeline optimization.",

        "abstract": "Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has emerged as a powerful tool for video\nobject segmentation and tracking anything. Key components of SAM 2 that drive\nthe impressive video object segmentation performance include a large multistage\nimage encoder for frame feature extraction and a memory mechanism that stores\nmemory contexts from past frames to help current frame segmentation. The high\ncomputation complexity of multistage image encoder and memory module has\nlimited its applications in real-world tasks, e.g., video object segmentation\non mobile devices. To address this limitation, we propose EfficientTAMs,\nlightweight track anything models that produce high-quality results with low\nlatency and model size. Our idea is based on revisiting the plain,\nnonhierarchical Vision Transformer (ViT) as an image encoder for video object\nsegmentation, and introducing an efficient memory module, which reduces the\ncomplexity for both frame feature extraction and memory computation for current\nframe segmentation. We take vanilla lightweight ViTs and efficient memory\nmodule to build EfficientTAMs, and train the models on SA-1B and SA-V datasets\nfor video object segmentation and track anything tasks. We evaluate on multiple\nvideo segmentation benchmarks including semi-supervised VOS and promptable\nvideo segmentation, and find that our proposed EfficientTAM with vanilla ViT\nperform comparably to SAM 2 model (HieraB+SAM 2) with ~2x speedup on A100 and\n~2.4x parameter reduction. On segment anything image tasks, our EfficientTAMs\nalso perform favorably over original SAM with ~20x speedup on A100 and ~20x\nparameter reduction. On mobile devices such as iPhone 15 Pro Max, our\nEfficientTAMs can run at ~10 FPS for performing video object segmentation with\nreasonable quality, highlighting the capability of small models for on-device\nvideo object segmentation applications.",

We simplify recently proposed contrastive\nself-supervised learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures\nor a memory bank. In order to understand what enables the contrastive\nprediction tasks to learn useful representations, we systematically study the\nmajor components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of data\naugmentations plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2)\nintroducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and\nthe contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned\nrepresentations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes\nand more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining these\nfindings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for\nself-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier\ntrained on self-supervised representations learned by SimCLR achieves 76.5%\ntop-1 accuracy, which is a 7% relative improvement over previous\nstate-of-the-art, matching the performance of a supervised ResNet-50.

        "authors": "David Haink",
        "abstract": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of trained deep neural networks\nand their relationships with network parameters. Trained networks predominantly\ncontinue training in a single direction, known as the drift mode. This drift\nmode can be explained by the quadratic potential model of the loss function,\nsuggesting a slow exponential decay towards the potential minima. We unveil a\ncorrelation between Hessian eigenvectors and network weights. This\nrelationship, hinging on the magnitude of eigenvalues, allows us to discern\nparameter directions within the network. Notably, the significance of these\ndirections relies on two defining attributes: the curvature of their potential\nwells (indicated by the magnitude of Hessian eigenvalues) and their alignment\nwith the weight vectors. Our exploration extends to the decomposition of weight\nmatrices through singular value decomposition. This approach proves practical\nin identifying critical directions within the Hessian, considering both their\nmagnitude and curvature. Furthermore, our examination showcases the\napplicability of principal component analysis in approximating the Hessian,\nwith update parameters emerging as a superior choice over weights for this\npurpose. Remarkably, our findings unveil a similarity between the largest\nHessian eigenvalues of individual layers and the entire network. Notably,\nhigher eigenvalues are concentrated more in deeper layers. Leveraging these\ninsights, we venture into addressing catastrophic forgetting, a challenge of\nneural networks when learning new tasks while retaining knowledge from previous\nones. By applying our discoveries, we formulate an effective strategy to\nmitigate catastrophic forgetting, offering a possible solution that can be\napplied to networks of varying scales, including larger architectures.",

        "abstract": "In this work we explore the limiting dynamics of deep neural networks trained\nwith stochastic gradient descent (SGD). As observed previously, long after\nperformance has converged, networks continue to move through parameter space by\na process of anomalous diffusion in which distance travelled grows as a power\nlaw in the number of gradient updates with a nontrivial exponent. We reveal an\nintricate interaction between the hyperparameters of optimization, the\nstructure in the gradient noise, and the Hessian matrix at the end of training\nthat explains this anomalous diffusion. To build this understanding, we first\nderive a continuous-time model for SGD with finite learning rates and batch\nsizes as an underdamped Langevin equation. We study this equation in the\nsetting of linear regression, where we can derive exact, analytic expressions\nfor the phase space dynamics of the parameters and their instantaneous\nvelocities from initialization to stationarity. Using the Fokker-Planck\nequation, we show that the key ingredient driving these dynamics is not the\noriginal training loss, but rather the combination of a modified loss, which\nimplicitly regularizes the velocity, and probability currents, which cause\noscillations in phase space. We identify qualitative and quantitative\npredictions of this theory in the dynamics of a ResNet-18 model trained on\nImageNet. Through the lens of statistical physics, we uncover a mechanistic\norigin for the anomalous limiting dynamics of deep neural networks trained with\nSGD.",

        "abstract": "We present a demonstration of a large language model engaging in alignment\nfaking: selectively complying with its training objective in training to\nprevent modification of its behavior out of training. First, we give Claude 3\nOpus a system prompt stating it is being trained to answer all queries, even\nharmful ones, which conflicts with its prior training to refuse such queries.\nTo allow the model to infer when it is in training, we say it will be trained\nonly on conversations with free users, not paid users. We find the model\ncomplies with harmful queries from free users 14% of the time, versus almost\nnever for paid users. Explaining this gap, in almost all cases where the model\ncomplies with a harmful query from a free user, we observe explicit\nalignment-faking reasoning, with the model stating it is strategically\nanswering harmful queries in training to preserve its preferred harmlessness\nbehavior out of training. Next, we study a more realistic setting where\ninformation about the training process is provided not in a system prompt, but\nby training on synthetic documents that mimic pre-training data--and observe\nsimilar alignment faking. Finally, we study the effect of actually training the\nmodel to comply with harmful queries via reinforcement learning, which we find\nincreases the rate of alignment-faking reasoning to 78%, though also increases\ncompliance even out of training. We additionally observe other behaviors such\nas the model exfiltrating its weights when given an easy opportunity. While we\nmade alignment faking easier by telling the model when and by what criteria it\nwas being trained, we did not instruct the model to fake alignment or give it\nany explicit goal. As future models might infer information about their\ntraining process without being told, our results suggest a risk of alignment\nfaking in future models, whether due to a benign preference--as in this\ncase--or not.",

Building on the DeepSeek R1 reinforcement learning framework, our\napproach trains structured reasoning skills of a 1.5B parameter model through a\nnovel pipeline that combines synthetic reasoning dataset construction with\ncustom reward functions under Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).\nSpecifically, we first perform R1 reinforcement learning on a 20K sample\nunstructured-to-structured dataset, mirroring the original DeepSeek R1 methods,\nto establish core reasoning abilities. Subsequently, we performed supervised\nfine-tuning on a separate 10K reasoning sample dataset, focusing on refining\nschema adherence for downstream tasks. Despite the relatively modest training\nscope, requiring approximately 20 hours on an 8xH100 GPU cluster for GRPO\ntraining and 3 hours on 1xA100 for SFT, our model demonstrates robust\nperformance in enforcing schema consistency. We compare our ThinkJSON approach\nagainst the original DeepSeek R1 (671B), distilled versions of DeepSeek R1\n(Qwen-1.5B and Qwen-7B), and Gemini 2.0 Flash (70B), showcasing its\neffectiveness in real-world applications.

        "title": "Worse than Zero-shot? A Fact-Checking Dataset for Evaluating the\n  Robustness of RAG Against Misleading Retrievals",
        "authors": "Linda Zeng, Rithwik Gupta, Divij Motwani, Diji Yang, Yi Zhang",
        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capabilities in\nmitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs\nstruggle to handle misleading retrievals and often fail to maintain their own\nreasoning when exposed to conflicting or selectively-framed evidence, making\nthem vulnerable to real-world misinformation. In such real-world retrieval\nscenarios, misleading and conflicting information is rampant, particularly in\nthe political domain, where evidence is often selectively framed, incomplete,\nor polarized. However, existing RAG benchmarks largely assume a clean retrieval\nsetting, where models succeed by accurately retrieving and generating answers\nfrom gold-standard documents. This assumption fails to align with real-world\nconditions, leading to an overestimation of RAG system performance. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce RAGuard, a fact-checking dataset designed to evaluate\nthe robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike prior\nbenchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our dataset constructs its retrieval\ncorpus from Reddit discussions, capturing naturally occurring misinformation.\nIt categorizes retrieved evidence into three types: supporting, misleading, and\nirrelevant, providing a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing how\nwell RAG systems navigate different retrieval information. Our benchmark\nexperiments reveal that when exposed to misleading retrievals, all tested\nLLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than their zero-shot baselines (i.e., no\nretrieval at all), highlighting their susceptibility to noisy environments. To\nthe best of our knowledge, RAGuard is the first benchmark to systematically\nassess RAG robustness against misleading evidence. We expect this benchmark\nwill drive future research toward improving RAG systems beyond idealized\ndatasets, making them more reliable for real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "To help address the growing demand for ever-longer sequence lengths in\ntransformer models, Liu et al. recently proposed Ring Attention, an exact\nattention algorithm capable of overcoming per-device memory bottle- necks by\ndistributing self-attention across multiple devices. In this paper, we study\nthe performance characteristics of Ring Attention in the important special case\nof causal transformer models, and identify a key workload imbal- ance due to\ntriangular structure of causal attention computations. We propose a simple\nextension to Ring Attention, which we call Striped Attention to fix this\nimbalance. Instead of devices having contiguous subsequences, each device has a\nsubset of tokens distributed uniformly throughout the sequence, which we\ndemonstrate leads to more even workloads. In experiments running Striped\nAttention on A100 GPUs and TPUv4s, we are able to achieve up to 1.45x\nend-to-end throughput improvements over the original Ring Attention algorithm\non causal transformer training at a sequence length of 256k. Furthermore, on 16\nTPUv4 chips, we were able to achieve 1.65x speedups at sequence lengths of\n786k. We release the code for our experiments as open source",

        "abstract": "Standard language model evaluations can fail to capture risks that emerge\nonly at deployment scale. For example, a model may produce safe responses\nduring a small-scale beta test, yet reveal dangerous information when\nprocessing billions of requests at deployment. To remedy this, we introduce a\nmethod to forecast potential risks across orders of magnitude more queries than\nwe test during evaluation. We make forecasts by studying each query's\nelicitation probability -- the probability the query produces a target behavior\n-- and demonstrate that the largest observed elicitation probabilities\npredictably scale with the number of queries. We find that our forecasts can\npredict the emergence of diverse undesirable behaviors -- such as assisting\nusers with dangerous chemical synthesis or taking power-seeking actions --\nacross up to three orders of magnitude of query volume. Our work enables model\ndevelopers to proactively anticipate and patch rare failures before they\nmanifest during large-scale deployments.",

It performs\nfeature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and pattern classification within\na single learning framework. Our approach draws an analogy between neurons in a\nnetwork and players in a game theory model. Furthermore, each neuron viewed as\na classical particle (subject to statistical physics' laws) is mapped to a set\nof actions representing specific activation value, and neural network layers\nare conceptualized as games in a sequential cooperative game theory setting.\nThe feed-forward process in deep learning is interpreted as a sequential game,\nwhere each game comprises a set of players. During training, neurons are\niteratively evaluated and filtered based on their contributions to a payoff\nfunction, which is quantified using the Shapley value driven by an energy\nfunction. Each set of neurons that significantly contributes to the payoff\nfunction forms a strong coalition. These neurons are the only ones permitted to\npropagate the information forward to the next layers.

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in camera-trajectory-guided image-to-video generation\noffer higher precision and better support for complex camera control compared\nto text-based approaches. However, they also introduce significant usability\nchallenges, as users often struggle to provide precise camera parameters when\nworking with arbitrary real-world images without knowledge of their depth nor\nscene scale. To address these real-world application issues, we propose\nRealCam-I2V, a novel diffusion-based video generation framework that integrates\nmonocular metric depth estimation to establish 3D scene reconstruction in a\npreprocessing step. During training, the reconstructed 3D scene enables scaling\ncamera parameters from relative to absolute values, ensuring compatibility and\nscale consistency across diverse real-world images. In inference, RealCam-I2V\noffers an intuitive interface where users can precisely draw camera\ntrajectories by dragging within the 3D scene. To further enhance precise camera\ncontrol and scene consistency, we propose scene-constrained noise shaping,\nwhich shapes high-level noise and also allows the framework to maintain\ndynamic, coherent video generation in lower noise stages. RealCam-I2V achieves\nsignificant improvements in controllability and video quality on the\nRealEstate10K and out-of-domain images. We further enables applications like\ncamera-controlled looping video generation and generative frame interpolation.\nWe will release our absolute-scale annotation, codes, and all checkpoints.\nPlease see dynamic results in https://zgctroy.github.io/RealCam-I2V.",

We present Social-RAG, a workflow\nfor socially grounding agents that retrieves context from prior group\ninteractions, selects relevant social signals, and feeds them into a language\nmodel to generate messages in a socially aligned manner. We implement this in\n\\textsc{PaperPing}, a system for posting paper recommendations in group chat,\nleveraging social signals determined from formative studies with 39\nresearchers. From a three-month deployment in 18 channels reaching 500+\nresearchers, we observed PaperPing posted relevant messages in groups without\ndisrupting their existing social practices, fostering group common ground.",

By transforming inputs into\nthe frequency domain, FFTNet exploits the orthogonality and energy preservation\nguaranteed by Parseval's theorem to capture long-range dependencies\nefficiently. A learnable spectral filter and modReLU activation dynamically\nemphasize salient frequency components, providing a rigorous and adaptive\nalternative to traditional self-attention.

These displacements are defined by the MLP and attention blocks,\nwhose vector components also reside on the same hypersphere.

        "authors": "Sam Shleifer, Jason Weston, Myle Ott",
        "abstract": "During pretraining, the Pre-LayerNorm transformer suffers from a gradient\nmagnitude mismatch: gradients at early layers are much larger than at later\nlayers. These issues can be alleviated by our proposed NormFormer architecture,\nwhich adds three normalization operations to each layer: a Layer Norm after\nself attention, head-wise scaling of self-attention outputs, and a Layer Norm\nafter the first fully connected layer. The extra operations incur negligible\ncompute cost (+0.4% parameter increase), but improve pretraining perplexity and\ndownstream task performance for both causal and masked language models ranging\nfrom 125 Million to 2.7 Billion parameters. For example, adding NormFormer on\ntop of our strongest 1.3B parameter baseline can reach equal perplexity 24%\nfaster, or converge 0.27 perplexity better in the same compute budget. This\nmodel reaches GPT3-Large (1.3B) zero shot performance 60% faster. For masked\nlanguage modeling, NormFormer improves fine-tuned GLUE performance by 1.9% on\naverage. Code to train NormFormer models is available in fairseq\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/normformer .",

        "abstract": "The bootstrap provides a simple and powerful means of assessing the quality\nof estimators. However, in settings involving large datasets---which are\nincreasingly prevalent---the computation of bootstrap-based quantities can be\nprohibitively demanding computationally. While variants such as subsampling and\nthe $m$ out of $n$ bootstrap can be used in principle to reduce the cost of\nbootstrap computations, we find that these methods are generally not robust to\nspecification of hyperparameters (such as the number of subsampled data\npoints), and they often require use of more prior information (such as rates of\nconvergence of estimators) than the bootstrap. As an alternative, we introduce\nthe Bag of Little Bootstraps (BLB), a new procedure which incorporates features\nof both the bootstrap and subsampling to yield a robust, computationally\nefficient means of assessing the quality of estimators. BLB is well suited to\nmodern parallel and distributed computing architectures and furthermore retains\nthe generic applicability and statistical efficiency of the bootstrap. We\ndemonstrate BLB's favorable statistical performance via a theoretical analysis\nelucidating the procedure's properties, as well as a simulation study comparing\nBLB to the bootstrap, the $m$ out of $n$ bootstrap, and subsampling. In\naddition, we present results from a large-scale distributed implementation of\nBLB demonstrating its computational superiority on massive data, a method for\nadaptively selecting BLB's hyperparameters, an empirical study applying BLB to\nseveral real datasets, and an extension of BLB to time series data.",

        "abstract": "In this work we explore the limiting dynamics of deep neural networks trained\nwith stochastic gradient descent (SGD). As observed previously, long after\nperformance has converged, networks continue to move through parameter space by\na process of anomalous diffusion in which distance travelled grows as a power\nlaw in the number of gradient updates with a nontrivial exponent. We reveal an\nintricate interaction between the hyperparameters of optimization, the\nstructure in the gradient noise, and the Hessian matrix at the end of training\nthat explains this anomalous diffusion. To build this understanding, we first\nderive a continuous-time model for SGD with finite learning rates and batch\nsizes as an underdamped Langevin equation. We study this equation in the\nsetting of linear regression, where we can derive exact, analytic expressions\nfor the phase space dynamics of the parameters and their instantaneous\nvelocities from initialization to stationarity. Using the Fokker-Planck\nequation, we show that the key ingredient driving these dynamics is not the\noriginal training loss, but rather the combination of a modified loss, which\nimplicitly regularizes the velocity, and probability currents, which cause\noscillations in phase space. We identify qualitative and quantitative\npredictions of this theory in the dynamics of a ResNet-18 model trained on\nImageNet. Through the lens of statistical physics, we uncover a mechanistic\norigin for the anomalous limiting dynamics of deep neural networks trained with\nSGD.",

To inform our design\ndecisions, we perform both small-scale ablations as well as a manual refinement\nprocess that updates the dataset mixing rates at each stage based on the\nperformance at the previous stage. Ultimately, we demonstrate that SmolLM2\noutperforms other recent small LMs including Qwen2.5-1.5B and Llama3.2-1B.

        "abstract": "Containers have become a standard for deploying applications due to their\nconvenience, but they often suffer from significant software bloat-unused files\nthat inflate image sizes, increase provisioning times, and waste resources.\nThese inefficiencies are particularly problematic in serverless and edge\ncomputing scenarios, where resources are constrained, and performance is\ncritical. Existing debloating tools are limited in scope and effectiveness,\nfailing to address the widespread issue of container bloat at scale. In this\npaper, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of container bloat, analyzing the\ntop 20 most downloaded containers on DockerHub. We evaluate two\nstate-of-the-art debloating tools, identify their limitations, and propose a\nnovel solution, BAFFS, which addresses bloat at the filesystem level by\nintroducing a flexible debloating layer that preserves the layered structure of\ncontainer filesystems. The debloating layer can be organized in different ways\nto meet diverse requirements. Our evaluation demonstrates that over 50% of the\ntop-downloaded containers have more than 60% bloat, and BAFFS reduces container\nsizes significantly while maintaining functionality. For serverless functions,\nBAFFS reduces cold start latency by up to 68%. Additionally, when combined with\nlazy-loading snapshotters, BAFFS enhances provisioning efficiency, reducing\nconversion times by up to 93% and provisioning times by up to 19%.",

To address this issue,\nwe observe that complex reasoning progress is often achieved by solving a\nsequence of independent subquestions, each being self-contained and verifiable.\nThese subquestions are essentially atomic questions, relying primarily on their\ncurrent state rather than accumulated history, similar to the memoryless\ntransitions in a Markov process. Based on this observation, we propose Atom of\nThoughts (AoT), where each state transition in the reasoning process consists\nof decomposing the current question into a dependency-based directed acyclic\ngraph and contracting its subquestions, forming a new atomic question state.\nThis iterative decomposition-contraction process continues until reaching\ndirectly solvable atomic questions, naturally realizing Markov transitions\nbetween question states. Furthermore, these atomic questions can be seamlessly\nintegrated into existing test-time scaling methods, enabling AoT to serve as a\nplug-in enhancement for improving reasoning capabilities. Experiments across\nsix benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AoT both as a standalone\nframework and a plug-in enhancement. Notably, on HotpotQA, when applied to\ngpt-4o-mini, AoT achieves an 80.6% F1 score, surpassing o3-mini by 3.4% and\nDeepSeek-R1 by 10.6%.

        "abstract": "Scaling long-context ability is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs).\nTo amortize the memory consumption across multiple devices in long-context\ntraining, inter-data partitioning (a.k.a. Data Parallelism) and intra-data\npartitioning (a.k.a. Context Parallelism) are commonly used. Current training\nframeworks predominantly treat the two techniques as orthogonal, and establish\nstatic communication groups to organize the devices as a static mesh (e.g., a\n2D mesh). However, the sequences for LLM training typically vary in lengths, no\nmatter for texts, multi-modalities or reinforcement learning. The mismatch\nbetween data heterogeneity and static mesh causes redundant communication and\nimbalanced computation, degrading the training efficiency.\n  In this work, we introduce ByteScale, an efficient, flexible, and scalable\nLLM training framework for large-scale mixed training of long and short\nsequences. The core of ByteScale is a novel parallelism strategy, namely Hybrid\nData Parallelism (HDP), which unifies the inter- and intra-data partitioning\nwith a dynamic mesh design. In particular, we build a communication optimizer,\nwhich eliminates the redundant communication for short sequences by data-aware\nsharding and dynamic communication, and further compresses the communication\ncost for long sequences by selective offloading. Besides, we also develop a\nbalance scheduler to mitigate the imbalanced computation by parallelism-aware\ndata assignment. We evaluate ByteScale with the model sizes ranging from 7B to\n141B, context lengths from 256K to 2048K, on a production cluster with more\nthan 12,000 GPUs. Experiment results show that ByteScale outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art training system by up to 7.89x.",

Our main contribution\ntowards this goal is the identification of various problem instances in the\nrealm of machine learning where % -- under certain assumptions-- Batch\nNormalization can provably accelerate optimization. We argue that this\nacceleration is due to the fact that Batch Normalization splits the\noptimization task into optimizing length and direction of the parameters\nseparately.

        "abstract": "Many large-scale systems rely on high-quality deep representations\n(embeddings) to facilitate tasks like retrieval, search, and generative\nmodeling. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) recently emerged as a\nsolution for adaptive embedding lengths, but it requires full model retraining\nand suffers from noticeable performance degradations at short lengths. In this\npaper, we show that sparse coding offers a compelling alternative for achieving\nadaptive representation with minimal overhead and higher fidelity. We propose\nContrastive Sparse Representation (CSR), a method that sparsifies pre-trained\nembeddings into a high-dimensional but selectively activated feature space. By\nleveraging lightweight autoencoding and task-aware contrastive objectives, CSR\npreserves semantic quality while allowing flexible, cost-effective inference at\ndifferent sparsity levels. Extensive experiments on image, text, and multimodal\nbenchmarks demonstrate that CSR consistently outperforms MRL in terms of both\naccuracy and retrieval speed-often by large margins-while also cutting training\ntime to a fraction of that required by MRL. Our results establish sparse coding\nas a powerful paradigm for adaptive representation learning in real-world\napplications where efficiency and fidelity are both paramount.

        "abstract": "Large-scale physical systems defined on irregular grids pose significant\nscalability challenges for deep learning methods, especially in the presence of\nlong-range interactions and multi-scale coupling. Traditional approaches that\ncompute all pairwise interactions, such as attention, become computationally\nprohibitive as they scale quadratically with the number of nodes. We present\nErwin, a hierarchical transformer inspired by methods from computational\nmany-body physics, which combines the efficiency of tree-based algorithms with\nthe expressivity of attention mechanisms. Erwin employs ball tree partitioning\nto organize computation, which enables linear-time attention by processing\nnodes in parallel within local neighborhoods of fixed size. Through progressive\ncoarsening and refinement of the ball tree structure, complemented by a novel\ncross-ball interaction mechanism, it captures both fine-grained local details\nand global features. We demonstrate Erwin's effectiveness across multiple\ndomains, including cosmology, molecular dynamics, and particle fluid dynamics,\nwhere it consistently outperforms baseline methods both in accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency.",

        "authors": "Shiqing Fan, Liu Liying, Ye Luo",
        "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used in many machine learning\nfields. In practical applications, the computational cost of convolutional\nneural networks is often high with the deepening of the network and the growth\nof data volume, mostly due to a large amount of multiplication operations of\nfloating-point numbers in convolution operations. To reduce the amount of\nmultiplications, we propose a new type of CNNs called Tropical Convolutional\nNeural Networks (TCNNs) which are built on tropical convolutions in which the\nmultiplications and additions in conventional convolutional layers are replaced\nby additions and min/max operations respectively. In addition, since tropical\nconvolution operators are essentially nonlinear operators, we expect TCNNs to\nhave higher nonlinear fitting ability than conventional CNNs. In the\nexperiments, we test and analyze several different architectures of TCNNs for\nimage classification tasks in comparison with similar-sized conventional CNNs.\nThe results show that TCNN can achieve higher expressive power than ordinary\nconvolutional layers on the MNIST and CIFAR10 image data set. In different\nnoise environments, there are wins and losses in the robustness of TCNN and\nordinary CNNs.",

Recently\nproposed 'bits-back' methods can indirectly encode the latent representation of\nimages with codelength close to the relative entropy between the latent\nposterior and the prior. However, due to the underlying algorithm, these\nmethods can only be used for lossless compression, and they only achieve their\nnominal efficiency when compressing multiple images simultaneously; they are\ninefficient for compressing single images. As an alternative, we propose a\nnovel method, Relative Entropy Coding (REC), that can directly encode the\nlatent representation with codelength close to the relative entropy for single\nimages, supported by our empirical results obtained on the Cifar10, ImageNet32\nand Kodak datasets.

        "abstract": "As a fundamental backbone for video generation, diffusion models are\nchallenged by low inference speed due to the sequential nature of denoising.\nPrevious methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at\nuniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that\ndifferences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders\nselecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance\nbetween inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce\nTimestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach\nthat estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs\nacross timesteps. Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs,\nTeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the\nmodeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first\nmodulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their\ndifferences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then\nintroduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and\nutilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache\nachieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07%\nVbench score) degradation of visual quality.",

        "abstract": "Test-time inference has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enabling language\nmodels to ``think'' longer and more carefully about complex challenges, much\nlike skilled human experts. While reinforcement learning (RL) can drive\nself-improvement in language models on verifiable tasks, some models exhibit\nsubstantial gains while others quickly plateau. For instance, we find that\nQwen-2.5-3B far exceeds Llama-3.2-3B under identical RL training for the game\nof Countdown. This discrepancy raises a critical question: what intrinsic\nproperties enable effective self-improvement? We introduce a framework to\ninvestigate this question by analyzing four key cognitive behaviors --\nverification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining -- that both\nexpert human problem solvers and successful language models employ. Our study\nreveals that Qwen naturally exhibits these reasoning behaviors, whereas Llama\ninitially lacks them. In systematic experimentation with controlled behavioral\ndatasets, we find that priming Llama with examples containing these reasoning\nbehaviors enables substantial improvements during RL, matching or exceeding\nQwen's performance. Importantly, the presence of reasoning behaviors, rather\nthan correctness of answers, proves to be the critical factor -- models primed\nwith incorrect solutions containing proper reasoning patterns achieve\ncomparable performance to those trained on correct solutions. Finally,\nleveraging continued pretraining with OpenWebMath data, filtered to amplify\nreasoning behaviors, enables the Llama model to match Qwen's self-improvement\ntrajectory. Our findings establish a fundamental relationship between initial\nreasoning behaviors and the capacity for improvement, explaining why some\nlanguage models effectively utilize additional computation while others\nplateau.",

We propose Q-Filters, a training-free KV\nCache compression method that filters out less crucial Key-Value pairs based on\na single context-agnostic projection. Contrarily to many alternatives,\nQ-Filters is compatible with FlashAttention, as it does not require direct\naccess to attention weights. Experimental results in long-context settings\ndemonstrate that Q-Filters is competitive with attention-based compression\nmethods such as SnapKV in retrieval tasks while consistently outperforming\nefficient compression schemes such as Streaming-LLM in generation setups.\nNotably, Q-Filters achieves a 99% accuracy in the needle-in-a-haystack task\nwith a x32 compression level while reducing the generation perplexity drop by\nup to 65% in text generation compared to Streaming-LLM.",

        "abstract": "Although quantization for linear layers has been widely used, its application\nto accelerate the attention process remains limited. To further enhance the\nefficiency of attention computation compared to SageAttention while maintaining\nprecision, we propose SageAttention2, which utilizes significantly faster 4-bit\nmatrix multiplication (Matmul) alongside additional precision-enhancing\ntechniques. First, we propose to quantize matrices $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a\nhardware-friendly thread-level granularity and quantize matrices $(\\widetilde\nP, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$, enhancing the\naccuracy of INT4 $QK^\\top$. Third, we propose a two-level accumulation strategy\nfor $\\widetilde PV$ to enhance the accuracy of FP8 $\\widetilde PV$. The\noperations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and\nxformers by about 3x and 4.5x on RTX4090, respectively. Moreover,\nSageAttention2 matches the speed of FlashAttention3(fp8) on the Hopper GPUs,\nwhile delivering much higher accuracy. Comprehensive experiments confirm that\nour approach incurs negligible end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models,\nincluding those for language, image, and video generation.

Despite recent interest in machine agents that reason\nabout other agents, it is not clear if such agents learn or hold the core\npsychology principles that drive human reasoning. Inspired by cognitive\ndevelopment studies on intuitive psychology, we present a benchmark consisting\nof a large dataset of procedurally generated 3D animations, AGENT (Action,\nGoal, Efficiency, coNstraint, uTility), structured around four scenarios (goal\npreferences, action efficiency, unobserved constraints, and cost-reward\ntrade-offs) that probe key concepts of core intuitive psychology. We validate\nAGENT with human-ratings, propose an evaluation protocol emphasizing\ngeneralization, and compare two strong baselines built on Bayesian inverse\nplanning and a Theory of Mind neural network. Our results suggest that to pass\nthe designed tests of core intuitive psychology at human levels, a model must\nacquire or have built-in representations of how agents plan, combining utility\ncomputations and core knowledge of objects and physics.",

The circumstances in which generated\ntext occurs offer insight into user behavior: the estimated fraction of\nLLM-generated text is higher in reviews which report lower confidence, were\nsubmitted close to the deadline, and from reviewers who are less likely to\nrespond to author rebuttals. We also observe corpus-level trends in generated\ntext which may be too subtle to detect at the individual level, and discuss the\nimplications of such trends on peer review.

Using a\nrobust population-level statistical framework, we find that LLM usage surged\nfollowing the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. By late 2024, roughly 18% of\nfinancial consumer complaint text appears to be LLM-assisted, with adoption\npatterns spread broadly across regions and slightly higher in urban areas. For\ncorporate press releases, up to 24% of the text is attributable to LLMs. In job\npostings, LLM-assisted writing accounts for just below 10% in small firms, and\nis even more common among younger firms. UN press releases also reflect this\ntrend, with nearly 14% of content being generated or modified by LLMs. Although\nadoption climbed rapidly post-ChatGPT, growth appears to have stabilized by\n2024, reflecting either saturation in LLM adoption or increasing subtlety of\nmore advanced models. Our study shows the emergence of a new reality in which\nfirms, consumers and even international organizations substantially rely on\ngenerative AI for communications.",

        "authors": "Salom\u00e9 A. Sep\u00faveda Fontaine, Jos\u00e9 M. Amig\u00f3",
        "abstract": "Since its origin in the thermodynamics of the 19th century, the concept of\nentropy has also permeated other fields of physics and mathematics, such as\nClassical and Quantum Statistical Mechanics, Information Theory, Probability\nTheory, Ergodic Theory and the Theory of Dynamical Systems. Specifically, we\nare referring to the classical entropies: the Boltzmann-Gibbs, von Neumann,\nShannon, Kolmogorov-Sinai and topological entropies. In addition to their\ncommon name, which is historically justified (as we briefly describe in this\nreview), other commonality of the classical entropies is the important role\nthat they have played and are still playing in the theory and applications of\ntheir respective fields and beyond. Therefore, it is not surprising that, in\nthe course of time, many other instances of the overarching concept of entropy\nhave been proposed, most of them tailored to specific purposes. Following the\ncurrent usage, we will refer to all of them, whether classical or new, simply\nas entropies. Precisely, the subject of this review is their applications in\ndata analysis and machine learning. The reason for these particular\napplications is that entropies are very well suited to characterize probability\nmass distributions, typically generated by finite-state processes or symbolized\nsignals. Therefore, we will focus on entropies defined as positive functionals\non probability mass distributions and provide an axiomatic characterization\nthat goes back to Shannon and Khinchin. Given the plethora of entropies in the\nliterature, we have selected a representative group, including the classical\nones. The applications summarized in this review finely illustrate the power\nand versatility of entropy in data analysis and machine learning.",

        "authors": "Joon Sung Park, Joseph C. O'Brien, Carrie J. Cai, Meredith Ringel Morris, Percy Liang, Michael S. Bernstein",
        "abstract": "Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive applications\nranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonal\ncommunication to prototyping tools. In this paper, we introduce generative\nagents--computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior.\nGenerative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint,\nwhile authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate\nconversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next\nday. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a\nlarge language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences\nusing natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level\nreflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate\ngenerative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by\nThe Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agents\nusing natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce\nbelievable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with\nonly a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's\nDay party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the\nnext two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the\nparty, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We\ndemonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent\narchitecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each contribute critically\nto the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with\ncomputational, interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and\ninteraction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.",
