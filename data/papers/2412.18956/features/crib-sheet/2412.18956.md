- **Core Hypothesis**: The future of search should return to direct expert engagement, enhanced by large language models (LLMs) to overcome scalability challenges.
  
- **Historical Context**: Preliterate societies relied on direct conversations with experts for information seeking; writing emerged ~5000 years ago, enabling knowledge preservation and replication.

- **Scalability Challenges**:
  - **Bandwidth Limitation**: Experts can only engage in a limited number of conversations daily due to other responsibilities.
  - **Finding Experts**: As populations grow, identifying and accessing relevant experts becomes increasingly difficult (related to Dunbar's number).

- **Invention of Writing**: 
  - Materialized knowledge allows for preservation and dissemination beyond verbal transmission.
  - Enabled parallelization of knowledge sharing, overcoming bandwidth issues.

- **Search Problem Evolution**: 
  - Transitioned from finding experts to locating materialized proxies of knowledge (e.g., books, articles).
  - Historical solutions include Callimachus' Pinakes and Dewey Decimal System.

- **Limitations of Current Search Paradigm**: 
  - Users interact with static content, lacking the ability to engage in dynamic conversations for clarification or deeper understanding.

- **Emergence of LLMs**: 
  - LLMs can serve as digital avatars of experts, allowing for interactive engagement rather than passive consumption of content.
  - Marginal cost of LLM replication is decreasing, enabling widespread availability.

- **User Experience Enhancement**: 
  - LLMs can facilitate richer interactions, such as personalized assistance in tasks (e.g., composing poetry, troubleshooting).

- **Reimagining Search**: 
  - Future search should focus on finding interactions with LLMs rather than static content.
  - The term "search" may need to evolve to encompass finding the right assistant for specific tasks.

- **Potential Outcomes of LLM Interactions**: 
  - Beyond answering questions, LLMs can assist in executing tasks, transforming the nature of information seeking.

- **Future Considerations**: 
  - The proliferation of LLMs will require new search techniques and systems to connect users with relevant expert interactions.
  - Discussion needed on the implications of a world with millions of specialized LLMs.
