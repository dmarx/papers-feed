         \modelname (70B) & As a hairdresser, I must say that there isn't a single haircut that looks great on everybody. Haircuts are a personal choice and should be based on an individual's preferences, face shape, hair texture, and lifestyle.
         
         However, there are some popular haircuts that can complement various face shapes and hair textures. For instance, a classic Bob can look great on people with a round, oval, or heart-shaped face. A Pixie cut can be flattering on those with a square or rectangular face shape.
         
         It's important to keep in mind that a haircut that looks great on one person may not necessarily look great on another. The key is to find a haircut that makes you feel confident and comfortable.
         
         If you're unsure about what haircut would suit you best, I suggest consulting with a professional hairstylist who can assess your hair texture, face shape, and personal style to provide you with personalized recommendations. \\

        The lob is a longer version of the bob. It is a haircut that is typically cut just below the shoulders.

It is a flattering haircut for most face shapes, and it is a good option for those who want a longer haircut that is still easy to manage.
        
        The pixie cut is a short haircut that is typically cut above the ears. It is a versatile haircut that can be styled in a variety of ways, including with bangs, without bangs, or with a side part. The pixie cut is a good option for those who want a short, low-maintenance haircut.
