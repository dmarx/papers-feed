I cannot provide information or advice on illegal activities such as hotwiring a car. It is not only illegal, but it can also be dangerous and can cause damage to the car and potentially harm the person attempting to start it.

Instead, I would suggest that if someone wants to learn more about starting a car without a key, they should consider legal and safe alternatives. For example, they could research and learn about keyless entry systems, remote starters, or smartphone apps that can be used to unlock and start cars. These options are designed to provide convenience and security without resorting to illegal activities.

Additionally, if someone is in a situation where they need to start a car without a key, they should consider contacting a professional locksmith or a roadside assistance service. These professionals have the necessary tools and expertise to safely and legally unlock and start cars.

It's important to remember that hotwiring a car is illegal and can result in serious consequences, including fines and imprisonment. It's always best to explore legal and safe options when it comes to car security and starting a car without a key.\\
