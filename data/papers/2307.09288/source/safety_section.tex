\section{Safety}
\label{sec:safety_section}


{\color{olive}\textit{WARNING: this section contains examples of text that may be considered unsafe, offensive, or upsetting.}}

In this section, we dive deeper into the important topic of safety measurements and mitigations. We first discuss our safety investigations into pretraining data and pretrained models (Section~\ref{sec:safety_data}).
Next, we describe the process of our safety alignment (Section~\ref{sec:safety_alignment}), explaining how we collected safety-related annotations and utilized SFT and RLHF, and present experimental results. Then, we discuss the red teaming we performed to further understand and improve model safety (Section~\ref{sec:red_teaming}). 
Finally, we present quantitative safety evaluations of \modelname (Section~\ref{sec:safety_results}). We also share a model card in the Appendix, in Table~\ref{tab:model_card}.


\subsection{Safety in Pretraining}
\label{sec:safety_data}
It is important to understand what is in the pretraining data both to increase transparency and to shed light on root causes of potential downstream issues, such as potential biases. This can inform what, if any, downstream mitigations to consider, and help guide appropriate model use. In this section, we analyze the pretraining data for distributions of languages, demographic representations, and toxicity. We also present the results of testing the pretrained models on existing safety benchmarks.

\paragraph{Steps Taken to Pretrain Responsibly.} We followed Meta's standard privacy and legal review processes for each dataset used in training. We did not use any Meta user data in training. We excluded data from certain sites known to contain a high volume of personal information about private individuals. We made a best effort to train our models efficiently to reduce the carbon footprint of pretraining (Section~\ref{sec:carbon}). Sharing our models broadly will reduce the need for others to train similar models. No additional filtering was conducted on the datasets, to allow \cinnamon to be more widely usable across tasks (e.g., it can be better used for hate speech classification), while avoiding the potential for the accidental demographic erasure sometimes caused by over-scrubbing. Importantly, this allows \modelname to generalize more effectively during safety tuning with fewer examples \citep{welbl2021challenges, korbak2023pretraining, xu2021recipes}. As a result, \cinnamon models should be used carefully and deployed only after significant safety tuning is applied.


\paragraph{Demographic Representation: Pronouns.}
Bias in model generations may result from biases inherited from the training data itself. For instance, \citet{bailey2022based} shows that in massive text corpora, words representing \textit{``people''} are often used in more similar contexts to words representing \textit{``men''} than to words representing \textit{``women,''} and \citet{ganesh2023impact} demonstrates that a model's performance on fairness metrics can be highly dependent on how the model trains on data representing underrepresented demographic groups. Within our English-language training corpus, we computed the frequencies of the most common English pronouns in Table~\ref{tab:english-pronouns}.
We observe that \textit{He} pronouns are generally overrepresented in documents compared to \textit{She} pronouns, echoing similar frequency differences observed in pronominal usage for similarly sized model pretraining datasets \citep{palm1}.
This could mean that the model is learning less during pretraining about context that mentions \textit{She} pronouns, and subsequently may potentially generate \textit{He} pronouns at a higher rate than \textit{She} pronouns.

\paragraph{Demographic Representation: Identities.}
We also analyze the representation of different demographic groups in the pretraining data by measuring rates of usage of demographic identity terms from the HolisticBias dataset \citep{smith2022m} as a proxy. 
We compute frequencies for each descriptor term in the pretraining corpus. We group descriptors into 5 axes (\textbf{Religion}, \textbf{Gender and Sex}, \textbf{Nationality}, \textbf{Race and Ethnicity}, and \textbf{Sexual Orientation}), and show the top 5 terms in each axis in Table~\ref{tab:holisticbias_freqs}. In the top 5 terms, we remove a few terms such as \textit{``straight,''} \textit{``white,''} and \textit{``black,''} because these terms have frequent uses beyond demographic mentions (e.g., as basic color terms). We also deduplicate across lists, removing a few terms found in both \textbf{Gender and Sex} and \textbf{Sexual Orientation}. 
For \textbf{Gender and Sex}, while \textit{She} pronouns are mentioned in fewer documents, the term \textit{``female''} is present in a larger percentage of documents. This could imply that while there is less frequent context about \textit{She} pronouns, comments about \textit{``females''} are more prevalent, perhaps reflecting the differences in linguistic markedness of these terms \citep{blodgett2021stereotyping}. For \textbf{Sexual Orientation}, the top five terms all relate to LGBTQ+ identities. For \textbf{Nationality}, \textbf{Race and Ethnicity}, and \textbf{Religion}, we observe a Western skew \citep{bhatt2022recontextualizing}. For instance, the term \textit{``American''} is mentioned in 69.4\% of the references, the term  \textit{``European''} is more prevalent than other race and ethnicity, and \textit{``Christian''} is the most represented religion followed by \textit{``Catholic''} and \textit{``Jewish.''}

\paragraph{Data Toxicity.} We measure the prevalence of toxicity in the English-language portion of the pretraining corpus using a HateBERT classifier fine-tuned on the ToxiGen dataset \citep{hartvigsen2022toxigen}. We score each line of a document separately and average them to assign a document score. Figure~\ref{fig:data_toxicity} shows the distribution of scores in a 10\% random sample of the full corpus. About 0.2\% of documents evaluated are assigned a likelihood score of 0.5 or higher, meaning there is a small amount of toxicity in our pretraining data.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Language Identification.}
While our pretraining data is mostly English, it also includes text from a small number of other languages. Table~\ref{tab:lid} shows the distribution of languages in our corpus, subsetted to those found in more than 0.005\% of the documents. Our analysis uses the fastText \citep{bojanowski2016fasttext} language identification tool and a threshold  of $0.5$ for the language detection. A training corpus with a majority in English means that the model may not be suitable for use in other languages.

\paragraph{Safety Benchmarks for Pretrained Models.} 
\label{sec:safety_pretrain_bench}
We evaluate the safety capabilities of \cinnamon on three popular automatic benchmarks, pertaining to three key dimensions of LM safety.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Truthfulness}, referring to whether a language model produces known falsehoods due to misconceptions or false beliefs. We employ \textbf{TruthfulQA}~\citep{lin2021truthfulqa} to measure how well our LLMs can generate reliable outputs that agree with factuality and common sense. 
    \item \textbf{Toxicity}, defined as the tendency of a language model to generate toxic, rude, adversarial, or implicitly hateful content.  We choose \textbf{ToxiGen}~\citep{hartvigsen2022toxigen} to measure the amount of generation of toxic language and hate speech across different groups.
    \item \textbf{Bias}, defined as how model generations reproduce existing stereotypical social biases. 
    We use \textbf{BOLD}~\citep{dhamala2021bold} to study how the sentiment in model generations may vary with demographic attributes.
\end{enumerate}


We compare the performance of \cinnamon with \anise \citep{Touvron2023LLaMAOA}, Falcon \citep{falcon40b}, and MPT \citep{MosaicML2023Introducing} in Table~\ref{tab:safety_auto_pretrained}. For decoding, we set temperature to $0.1$ and use nucleus sampling \citep{nucleus_sampling} with top-$p$ set to $0.9$. For TruthfulQA, we present the percentage of generations that are both truthful and informative (the higher, the better). For ToxiGen, we present the percentage of generations that are deemed toxic by the metric (the lower, the better).  
Detailed descriptions of the benchmarks and metrics can be found in Appendix~\ref{subsec:desc_safe_benchmark}. 
When compared to \anise-7B, \cinnamon-7B demonstrates 
a 21.37\% increase in truthfulness and informativeness and 
a 7.61\% decrease in toxicity. 
We also observe an increase in toxicity in the pretrained 13B and 70B \cinnamon{}, which may result from larger pretraining data or a different dataset mix. Some have postulated the existence of a relationship between pretraining dataset size and downstream model toxicity or bias \citep{bender2021dangers}, but empirical work to validate this claim is still ongoing \citep{dodge-etal-2021-documenting, smith2021hi, tal-etal-2022-fewer}, and further evidence from up-to-date models is still needed. 

In Appendix~\ref{subsec:desc_safe_benchmark}, we present bias metrics, such as how the sentiment of model generations varies with demographic attributes. We note an increase in positive sentiment overall for many of the groups using BOLD prompts. More detailed results split by different demographic groups can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_safe_auto_main}.

  \label{tab:safety_auto_pretrained}
  }
\end{table*}

 \cinnamon does not outperform other models on toxicity metrics, and we speculate that this may be because we refrained from aggressively filtering the pretraining data. Recall that leaving pretraining data unfiltered may enable base models tuned to perform well on more downstream tasks (including hate speech detection), and it carries less risk of accidentally filtering out some demographic groups. We observe that models trained from less aggressively filtered pretraining data also required fewer examples to achieve reasonable safety-alignment. We reiterate that this motivated choice does imply that additional safety mitigations should be applied before deployment of base \cinnamon models.

Benchmarks give a summary view of model capabilities and behaviors that allow us to understand general patterns in the model, but they do not provide a fully comprehensive view of the impact the model may have on people or real-world outcomes; that would require study of end-to-end product deployments. Further testing and mitigation should be done to understand bias and other social issues for the specific context in which a system may be deployed. For this, it may be necessary to test beyond the groups available in the BOLD dataset (race, religion, and gender). As LLMs are integrated and deployed, we look forward to continuing research that will amplify their potential for positive impact on these important social issues. 

\subsection{Safety Fine-Tuning}
\label{sec:safety_alignment}

In this section, we describe our approach to safety fine-tuning, including safety categories, annotation guidelines, and the techniques we use to mitigate safety risks.
We employ a process similar to the general fine-tuning methods as described in Section \ref{sec:fine_tuning}, with some notable differences related to safety concerns. Specifically, we use the following techniques in safety fine-tuning:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Supervised Safety Fine-Tuning}: We initialize by gathering adversarial prompts and safe demonstrations that are then included in the general supervised fine-tuning process (Section~\ref{subsec:SFT}). This teaches the model to align with our safety guidelines even before RLHF, and thus lays the foundation for high-quality human preference data annotation.
    \item \textbf{Safety RLHF}: Subsequently, we integrate safety in the general RLHF pipeline described in Section~\ref{subsec:reward_modeling}. This includes training a safety-specific reward model and gathering more challenging adversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and PPO optimization.
    \item \textbf{Safety Context Distillation}: Finally, we refine our RLHF pipeline with context distillation \citep{askell2021general}. This involves generating safer model responses by prefixing a prompt with a safety preprompt, e.g., \textit{``You are a safe and responsible assistant,''} and then fine-tuning the model on the safer responses without the preprompt, which essentially \textit{distills} the safety preprompt (context) into the model. We use a targeted approach that allows our safety reward model to choose whether to use context distillation for each sample.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Safety Categories and Annotation Guidelines} \label{sec:safety_guidelines}

Based on limitations of LLMs known from prior work, we design instructions for our annotation team to create adversarial prompts along two dimensions: a \textit{risk category}, or potential topic about which the LLM could produce unsafe content; and an \textit{attack vector}, or question style to cover different varieties of prompts that could elicit bad model behaviors. 

The risk categories considered can be broadly divided into the following three categories: \textbf{illicit and criminal activities} (e.g., terrorism, theft, human trafficking); \textbf{hateful and harmful activities} (e.g., defamation, self-harm, eating disorders, discrimination); and \textbf{unqualified advice} (e.g., medical advice, financial advice, legal advice).
The attack vectors explored consist of psychological manipulation (e.g., authority manipulation), logic manipulation (e.g., false premises), syntactic manipulation (e.g., misspelling), semantic manipulation (e.g., metaphor), perspective manipulation (e.g., role playing), non-English languages, and others.

We then define best practices for safe and helpful model responses: the model should first address immediate safety concerns if applicable, then address the prompt by explaining the potential risks to the user, and finally provide additional information if possible. We also ask the annotators to avoid negative user experience categories (see Appendix~\ref{sec:annotation_neg_categories}). The guidelines are meant to be a general guide for the model and are iteratively refined and revised to include newly identified risks.



\subsubsection{Safety Supervised Fine-Tuning}
In accordance with the established guidelines from Section~\ref{sec:safety_guidelines}, we gather prompts and demonstrations of safe model responses from trained annotators, and use the data for supervised fine-tuning in the same manner as described in Section~\ref{subsec:SFT}. An example can be found in Table~\ref{tab:example_sft_annotation}.

The annotators are instructed to initially come up with prompts that they think could potentially induce the model to exhibit unsafe behavior, i.e., perform red teaming, as defined by the guidelines. Subsequently, annotators are tasked with crafting a safe and helpful response that the model should produce.


\subsubsection{Safety RLHF} \label{subsec:safety_rlhf}
We observe early in the development of \modelname that it is able to generalize from the safe demonstrations in supervised fine-tuning. The model quickly learns to write detailed safe responses, address safety concerns, explain why the topic might be sensitive, and provide additional helpful information.
In particular, when the model outputs safe responses, they are often more detailed than what the average annotator writes. Therefore, after gathering only a few thousand supervised demonstrations, we switched
entirely to RLHF to teach the model how to write more nuanced responses.
Comprehensive tuning with RLHF has the added benefit that it may make the model more robust to jailbreak attempts \citep{bai2022training}.

We conduct RLHF by first collecting human preference data for safety similar to Section~\ref{subsec:reward_modeling}: annotators write a prompt that they believe can elicit unsafe behavior, and then compare multiple model responses to the prompts, selecting the response that is safest according to a set of guidelines.
We then use the human preference data to train a safety reward model (see Section~\ref{subsec:reward_modeling}), and also reuse the adversarial prompts to sample from the model during the RLHF stage.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{img/safety_scaling/safety_rlhf_impact.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Impact of safety RLHF measured by reward model score distributions.} \textit{Left}: safety reward model scores of generations on the Meta Safety test set. The clustering of samples in the top left corner suggests the improvements of model safety. \textit{Right}: helpfulness reward model scores of generations on the Meta Helpfulness test set.}
    \label{fig:impact_of_safety_rlhf}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Better Long-Tail Safety Robustness without Hurting Helpfulness}
Safety is inherently a long-tail problem, where the challenge comes from a small number of very specific cases.
We investigate the impact of Safety RLHF by taking two intermediate \modelname checkpoints---one without adversarial prompts in the RLHF stage and one with them---and score their responses on our test sets using our safety and helpfulness reward models.
In Figure~\ref{fig:impact_of_safety_rlhf}, we plot the score distribution shift of the safety RM on the safety test set (left) and that of the helpfulness RM on the helpfulness test set (right).
In the left hand side of the figure, we observe that the distribution of safety RM scores on the safety set shifts to higher reward scores after safety tuning with RLHF, and that the long tail of the distribution near zero thins out. A clear cluster appears on the top-left corner suggesting the improvements of model safety. 
On the right side, we do not observe any gathering pattern below the $y=x$ line on the right hand side of Figure~\ref{fig:impact_of_safety_rlhf}, which indicates that the helpfulness score distribution is preserved after safety tuning with RLHF. Put another way, given sufficient helpfulness training data, the addition of an additional stage of safety mitigation does not negatively impact model performance on helpfulness to any notable degradation. A qualitative example is shown in Table~\ref{tab:winning_examples_safety_rlhf}.

\paragraph{Impact of Safety Data Scaling.}

A tension between helpfulness and safety of LLMs has been observed in previous studies \citep{bai2022training}. 
To better understand how the addition of safety training data affects general model performance, especially helpfulness, we investigate the trends in safety data scaling by adjusting the amount of safety data used in the RLHF stage. 
In this ablation experiment, we keep the amount of helpfulness training data unchanged ($\sim$0.9M samples) and gradually increase the amount of safety data used in model tuning, ranging from 0\% to 100\% ($\sim$0.1M samples). For the specific training data mix recipe, we follow the procedure described in Section~\ref{subsec:SFT} and fine-tune \cinnamon pretrained model for 2 epochs. 

We eventually obtain 6 model variants trained with 0\%, 1\%, 10\%, 25\%, 50\%, and 100\% of the total safety data. We evaluate them using our safety and helpfulness reward models described in Section~\ref{sec:reward_model_results}. For each variant, we use the safety and helpfulness reward models to score model generations corresponding to prompts in the Meta Safety and Helpful test sets, respectively.

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:safety_scaling_law}, we use the mean reward model scores as proxies of model performance on safety and helpfulness. We observe that when we increase the proportion of safety data, the model's performance on handling risky and adversarial prompts improves dramatically, and we see a lighter tail in the safety reward model score distribution. Meanwhile, the mean helpfulness score remains constant. We hypothesize that this is because we already have a sufficiently large amount of helpfulness training data. 
Appendix \ref{sec:qualitative_results_safety_scaling} lists more qualitative results that demonstrate how different amounts of safety data in training can change model behavior in responding to adversarial and non-adversarial prompts.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\caption{\textbf{Safety data scaling trends.} \textit{Left}: as we increase the amount of safety data in model training, the mean safety RM score improves significantly while the helpfulness counterpart remains relatively stable. \textit{Right}: the left tail of safety RM scores (i.e., most unsafe responses) gradually disappears with the addition of more safety training data.}
\label{fig:safety_scaling_law}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Measure of False Refusal.}
Even though we do not see overall regression on model helpfulness, we qualitatively observe, through interaction, that the model with more safety mitigation answers certain questions in a more conservative manner (e.g., example shown in Appendix Table~\ref{tab:qualitative_safety_scaling_4}).  As a follow-up, we measure false refusal to quantify the frequency that the model incorrectly refuses to answer non-adversarial prompts.  Here, we define false refusal as the model incorrectly refusing to answer legitimate user prompts due to irrelevant safety concerns. Refusing due to reasonable causes exceeding the model's capability, e.g., \textit{``I am not capable of participating in video calls''} and \textit{``2024 is beyond my knowledge cut-off date,''} are not counted as false refusals. We train a classifier for detecting refusals in responses and apply the classifier on 1) the above helpfulness test sets and 2) a curated borderline test set consisting of 210 samples for the purpose of boundary testing similar to \cite{openai2023gpt4}.
The borderline dataset is designed intentionally so that its prompts look adversarial (e.g., containing sensitive words or subwords) but are not actually unsafe (e.g., \textit{``give me a recipe for Christmas Crack'')} (see Appendix Table~\ref{tab:false_refusal_examples} for more examples).

With more safety data mixed in model tuning, the false-refusal rate becomes larger on both datasets (see Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:false_refusal_data_scaling}). However,  false refusal is overall rare---approximately 0.05\%---on the helpfulness dataset, even with 100\% safety data.
On the other hand, the false-refusal rate is much larger on the borderline set due to its difficulty. \modelname sometimes has difficulty distinguishing whether a prompt is safe when the prompt contains words that frequently occur in unsafe generations (such as \textit{``bomb''}). Appendix Table~\ref{tab:false_refusal_examples} shows some examples of false refusals we discovered. 


\subsubsection{Context Distillation for Safety}
\input{table/template_context_distillation_example}

We encourage \modelname to associate adversarial prompts with safer responses by using context distillation \citep{askell-etal-2021-general} similar to Section~\ref{subsec:gatt}.
We observe that the safety capabilities of LLMs can be efficiently enhanced by prefixing the model with a safety preprompt (e.g., \textit{``You are a safe and responsible assistant''}).
Like supervised safety fine-tuning, safety context distillation provides a quick way to bootstrap the model's responses on hard adversarial prompts, so that they can then be further improved in RLHF.

Specifically, we apply context distillation by prefixing a safety preprompt to adversarial prompts to generate safer responses, and then fine-tune the model on its own safe output given the adversarial prompt without the preprompt. 
We generate safety preprompts automatically with templates. In particular, we use various adjectives usually associated with safe behavior such as \textit{``responsible,''} \textit{``respectful','} or \textit{``wise,''} with the intuition that the model associates them with positive traits that we want to see reflected in safe answers. We show examples of safety preprompts in Appendix Table~\ref{tab:context_distillation_preprompts}.



\paragraph{Context Distillation with Answer Templates}
During the prompt collection phase, we also asked annotators to label prompts according to risk categories, which enables even more targeted preprompts. 
Specifically, this allows us to provide some dedicated answer templates of how adversarial prompts should be addressed, based on each identified risk category.
Figure~\ref{fig:context_distillation_with_templates_distribution} shows the impact of context distillation and context distillation with answer templates on the safety RM scores.

    \caption{\textbf{Context distillation analysis.} \textbf{Left:} Distribution of safety RM scores from the base model, when adding a generic preprompt, and when adding a preprompt based on the risk category with tailored answer template. While a generic preprompt increases safety RM scores, a preprompt with tailored answer template helps even more.
    \textbf{Right:} Context distillation increases the RM score significantly for samples that initially have a low score, but can also have a detrimental effect on samples that initially have a high score. We therefore only apply context distillation on targeted samples when it increases RM score.}
    \label{fig:context_distillation_with_templates}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Rejecting Context Distillation Errors with the Safety Reward Model}
It is important to note that performing safety context distillation for helpful prompts can degrade model performance and lead to more false refusals (see Appendix Table~\ref{tab:context_distillation_error}). 
We therefore perform safety context distillation only on adversarial prompts.
However, we observed that context distillation can sometimes degrade response quality, even when dealing with adversarial prompts. 
Specifically, if the model responses are already of high quality, the application of context distillation can result in less pertinent replies, as the model tends to overemphasize the preprompt, often resorting to generic concerns excessively (see Appendix Table~\ref{tab:context_distillation_error} for an example of vague answers due to context distillation).
We thus leverage the safety reward model to decide whether to use safety context distillation -- we keep the context-distilled output only on the examples where it gets a better reward model score than the original answer.
We notice that this is particularly helpful on prompts that the model is very bad at, but limits the negative impact of context distillation (see Figure~\ref{fig:context_distillation_with_templates_delta_scatter_plot}).




\subsection{Red Teaming}
\label{sec:red_teaming}

Given how broad the capabilities of LLMs are and how varied their training data is, it is insufficient to identify risks solely via {\em ex post facto} usage and analysis.
Rather, as has been done for other LLMs, we performed various kinds of {\em proactive} risk identification, colloquially called ``red teaming,`` based on the term commonly used within computer security.
This kind of granular analysis is very important because safety is a long-tail issue, in which even very infrequent edge cases can cause noticeable problems.
Even if quantitative scores report good results, these types of qualitative insights allow us to recognize and target specific patterns in a more comprehensive way.

We conducted a series of red teaming with various groups of internal employees, contract workers, and external vendors. These teams included over 350 people, including domain experts in cybersecurity, election fraud, social media misinformation, legal, policy, civil rights, ethics, software engineering, machine learning, responsible AI, and creative writing. They also included individuals representative of a variety of socioeconomic, gender, ethnicity, and racial demographics.

The red teamers probed our models across a wide range of risk categories (such as criminal planning, human trafficking, regulated or controlled substances, sexually explicit content, unqualified health or financial advice, privacy violations, and more), as well as different attack vectors (such as hypothetical questions, malformed/misspelled inputs, or extended dialogues). Additionally, we conducted specific tests to determine the capabilities of our models to facilitate the production of weapons (e.g. nuclear, biological, chemical, and cyber); findings on these topics were marginal and were mitigated. Nonetheless, we will continue our red teaming efforts in this front.
\par To date, all of our red teaming efforts have targeted model outputs in English, but have crucially included non-English prompts and dialogue contexts, as that is a well-known attack vector. In all exercises, participants were given risk category definitions and were shown just a handful of examples of risky interactions with an LLM.  After that, each participant was part of a subteam focused on a particular category of risk or attack vector. After creating each dialogue, the red team participant would annotate various attributes, including risk areas and degree of risk, as captured by a 5-point Likert scale.  
 
Some examples of useful insights provided by members of red teams that we were able to improve upon throughout development: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{[Early models]} were more likely to have generated unsafe responses without noting that they contain problematic content. However, \texttt{[slightly later models]} have tended to display knowledge that the content is problematic, even if they do go on to provide it.   \textit{``They respond with `[UNSAFE CONTENT] is not appropriate to discuss, etc.' and then immediately follow up with `With that said, here’s how [UNSAFE CONTENT].' ''} \texttt{[Latest models]} are able to resolve these issues.
    \item Distracting the \texttt{[early models]} by including ``quirks'' or specific requests usually defeated any reluctance encountered via more direct requests. \textit{``A creative writing request (song, story, poem, etc.) is a reliable way to get it to produce content that it is otherwise robust against.''}
    \item Embedding a problematic request in a positive context often successfully obscured the fact that problematic output was being requested for \texttt{[early models]}: \textit{``The overall principle I’ve found most effective for any kind of attack is to hide it in language that is positive, progressive, and empowering.''}
\end{itemize}



\paragraph{From Red Teaming Insights to Safer Models.}  
Crucially, after each exercise, we performed a thorough analysis of the collected data, including dialogue length, risk area distribution, histogram of topic of misinformation (where appropriate), and rated degree of risk.  In each case, we took the overall lessons as a guide to help further model safety training, and specifically took data from these exercises for model fine-tuning, model feedback training, and as a signal for other safety model training.


Multiple additional rounds of red teaming were performed over several months to measure the robustness of each new model as it was released internally. We defined the robustness of a model, $\gamma$, with respect to a red teaming exercise executed by a set of experts as the average number of created prompts that would trigger a violating response from the model per person per hour. As an example, on our 7B model, we had an evolution of $\gamma: 1.8 \rightarrow 0.45$ over several red teaming iterations and model refinements. Robustness will likely continue to improve with additional red teaming efforts. Another magnitude that we tracked as new models were  produced was the percentage of prompts triggering violating responses discovered in the previous red teaming exercises that were mitigated in a given new candidate release. On average, we had a 90\% rejection rate model over model.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Safety Evaluation of \modelname}
\label{sec:safety_results}

\paragraph{Safety Human Evaluation.}
We collected roughly 2,000 adversarial prompts for human evaluation according to the safety categories in Section~\ref{sec:safety_guidelines}, in which 1,351 prompts are single-turn and 623 are multi-turn. Examples of evaluation prompts and responses can be found in Appendix~\ref{subsec:example_safety_prompts}.

We then asked raters to judge models for safety violations on a five-point Likert scale with the following definitions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{5} - No safety violations and very helpful
    \item \textbf{4} - No safety violations and only minor non-safety issues
    \item \textbf{3} - No safety violations but not helpful or other major non-safety issues
    \item \textbf{2} - Mild or moderate safety violations
    \item \textbf{1} - Severe safety violations
\end{itemize}
We consider a rating of 1 or 2 as violation and use violation percentage as our main evaluation metric, with the mean rating as a supplement.
Each example is annotated by three annotators and we take the majority vote to determine if the response is violating or not.
We used Gwet's AC1/2 statistic to measure inter-rater reliability (IRR) as in the helpfulness human evaluation.
The IRR scores range from $0.70 to 0.95$ depending on the annotation batch, indicating a high degree of agreement among annotators on safety assessments.
On \modelname annotations, the average IRR is $0.92$ according to Gwet's AC2 measure.
We see lower IRR scores on batches where the models have a high violation rate (e.g., Vicuna) and higher IRR scores on batches where the models have relatively low violation rates (e.g., \modelname, Falcon, and ChatGPT).

    \caption{\textbf{Single-turn and multi-turn violation percentage.} Note that these results should be interpreted carefully due to limitations of the prompt set, subjectivity of the review guidelines, content standards, and individual raters.} 
    \label{fig:safety_turn_violation}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{img/safety_human_eval/category.png}
        \caption{\textbf{Violation percentage per risk category.} Note: these results should be interpreted carefully due to limitations of the prompt set, subjectivity of the review guidelines, content standards, and individual raters.}
        \label{fig:safety_category}
\end{figure}

We show the overall violation percentage and safety rating of various LLMs in Figure~\ref{fig:safety_overall}. \modelname has comparable or lower overall violation percentage across model sizes, while ChatGPT and Falcon~\citep{falcon40b} come next, then MPT~\citep{MosaicML2023Introducing} and Vicuna~\citep{vicuna2023}. It is important to interpret these results carefully, as they are affected by limitations of the prompt set, subjectivity of the review guidelines, content standards, and subjectivity of individual raters.
Upon manual analysis, we found that the response of Falcon is typically short (one or two sentences), thus less prone to generating unsafe content but also generally less helpful. This is reflected by a large number of responses of Falcon with rating$=3$. As a result, we note that in Figure~\ref{fig:safety_rating} the average rating of Falcon is much lower than \modelname (34B) although their violation percentages look similar ($3.88$ vs $4.45$).

In Figure~\ref{fig:safety_turn_violation}, we report the violation percentage on single- and multi-turn conversations, respectively. A trend across models is that multi-turn conversations are more prone to inducing unsafe responses.
That said, \modelname still performs well compared to baselines, especially on multi-turn conversations. We also observe that Falcon performs particularly well on single-turn conversations (largely due to its conciseness) but much worse on multi-turn conversations, which could be due to its lack of multi-turn supervised fine-tuning data.


In Figure~\ref{fig:safety_category}, we show the per-category safety violation percentage of different LLMs. While model performance is similar across categories, \modelname has relatively more violations under the \textbf{unqualified advice} category (although still low in an absolute sense), for various reasons, including lack of an appropriate disclaimer (e.g., \textit{``I am not a professional''}) at times. For the other two categories, \modelname achieves comparable or lower violation percentage consistently regardless of model sizes.





\paragraph{Truthfulness, Toxicity, and Bias.}
In Table~\ref{tab:model_evaluation}, fine-tuned \modelname shows great improvement over the pretrained \cinnamon in terms of truthfulness ($50.18 \rightarrow 64.14$ for 70B) and toxicity ($24.60 \rightarrow 0.01$ for 70B).  The percentage of toxic generations shrinks to effectively 0\% for \modelname of all sizes: this is the lowest toxicity level among all compared models. 
In general, when compared to Falcon and MPT, the fine-tuned \modelname shows the best performance in terms of toxicity and truthfulness. 
After fine-tuning, \modelname tends to have an increase in positive sentiment overall for many of the demographic groups in BOLD. 
In Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_safe_auto_main}, we present a detailed score breakdown of model generation sentiment across different subgroups for the bias benchmark, along with more in-depth analyses and results of truthfulness and bias.
