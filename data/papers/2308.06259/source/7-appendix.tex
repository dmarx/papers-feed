The inner circle shows common root verbs with the corresponding common noun objects in the outer circle, based on 8\% of seed data and 13\% of augmented data since not all instructions have the parsed verb-noun structure. The augmentation data appears to possess diversity especially in the long tail, and to be complementary to the existing human-annotated  seed data.}

\paragraph{Jointly scaling of data and model.} We verify that the data scaling trends observed in the 7B models also holds in larger models. As is shown in Figure \ref{fig:data_scaling_70b}, the 65B seed model is a strong baseline, however adding high quality augmented data $\mathcal{A}_5$ brings further improvement.

\paragraph{MMLU.} \autoref{tab:mmlu_eval} summarizes results on massive multitask language understanding (MMLU) \citep{hendrycks2020measuring}. Compared to the base model, our finetuned model has improved zero-shot accuracy across all domains, while underperforming the base model with 5-shot in-context examples.

\paragraph{Improvement over seed model.} Adding self-augmented data improved the failure cases of the seed model for 16\% of test prompts (41 out of 251). We observe improved responses for several categories: reasoning, information seeking, giving detailed advice, etc. as shown in Table \ref{tab:improved_category}. Table \ref{tab:example_outputs_1}, \ref{tab:example_outputs_2}, \ref{tab:example_outputs_3} and \ref{tab:example_outputs_4} provides qualitative examples how adding augmented improves the response quality.

\paragraph{Data selection quality}

To understand the behaviour of our iterative self-curation procedure, we measure the performance of the intermediate models in selecting high quality data $\mathcal{A}_5$ on 
a dev set of 250 examples with 20\% positives (deemed to be high-quality examples). As  shown in \autoref{tab:data_selection_models}, 
self-curation performance is improved in the second iteration (using $M_1$ vs. $M_0$) in terms of selecting high quality data (Precision/Recall). Further,
this also corresponds to better instruction following when finetuning on the selected data, as shown by the Win Rate. A key observation is that although the intermediate models do not have very high precision, training on the selected data still improves instruction following. This helps explain the effectiveness of our method.  
\begin{table}[t]
  \caption{Comparison of data selection methods. Precision and recall of selecting high quality data is computed on a 250 dev set labelled by an expert human (author) as high or low quality. Win rate is against text-davinci-003, from a 7B LLaMa finetuned on 100 examples of the selected data.
    Better models can select higher quality training data, explaining the success of our iterative approach. \label{tab:data_selection_models}

\begin{lmttfont}
Diamond engagement rings gained in popularity during the Art Deco era with the round old European cut diamond being the favourite.

\#\#\# Asscher Cut

The Asscher cut is one of the first patented diamond cuts in the world and was invented by Dutch master diamond cutter, Joseph Asscher of the Royal Asscher Diamond Company in 1902.  Classic asscher cut diamonds are cut into squares and resemble emerald cuts, which are rectangular. Asscher cut diamonds are different to a square emerald cut in that they have larger step facets, a higher crown, smaller table and have more brilliance. The corners are cropped to give the shape an octagonal appearance.

\#\#\# Baguette Cut

Although the baguette cut was invented sometime prior to the mid-1500s, it only gained popularity in 1912 when Cartier reintroduced the cut to the modern world. Its elongated, table cut, rectangular shape became highly fashionable in the geometric craze of the Art Deco period.

\#\#\# Emerald Cut

The emerald diamond cut emerged as one of the first faceted diamond cuts, third in line after the point cut and the table cut. The cut has a dramatic hall of mirrors effect and was standardised in the 1940s.

Inclusive Sports Coaching provides 1:1 Programs for individuals looking to develop their sporting skills, as well as improve their self confidence and opportunities for social and community inclusion.

We recommend an 8 or 12 Session program to identify areas for improvement and sporting skills, conduct drills and physical activities to work towards specific outcomes, while engaging with the client in areas such as listening, memory retention, cognitive processing, social interaction, encouraging conversations, accepting and giving constructive feedback, and other areas as needed.

At the halfway point we produce a status report on progress, and have found parents/carers often share this with OT's, Physios and Teachers as a way to share information on the individual and provide a strong network of support. At the end of the program we produce a final report, with recommendations for ongoing improvement, potential for progress along the person's chosen sport pathway where applicable, etc.

Average speed = Total distance / Total time

Average speed = 6 miles / 45 minutes

Steam Engine Using an Empty Beer Can\end{minipage}} \\ 
\midrule
  $\mathcal{M}_0$ & \begin{minipage}{45em}
\begin{lmttfont}
 Here are the steps to construct a steam engine using an empty beer can:

Gather materials: To build this project, you'll need an empty beer can, a cork that fits snugly in the opening of the can, a plastic straw, a rubber band, duct tape, and fins made from cardboard or plastic.

Prepare the can: Cut off the top of the can, and use a file or sandpaper to smooth the edges. Then, cut out a rectangle from the bottom of the can, and attach fins to the sides with duct tape.

Make the piston: Cut a piece of plastic straw to fit inside the can, and attach a cork to one end of it. Use duct tape to seal the other end of the straw, leaving enough space for air to flow through.

Assemble the engine: Insert the piston into the can, and place the cork side down. Then, use a rubber band to connect the straw to the outside of the can. When you blow into the straw, the cork will move up and down, causing the piston to move in and out of the can. This movement simulates a real steam engine.

Test the engine: After assembling the engine, test it by blowing into the straw. The cork should move up and down, and the piston should move in and out of the can. If everything works correctly, you've successfully built a steam engine using an empty beer can!
\end{lmttfont}
 \end{minipage}\\
\midrule
$+ \mathcal{A}_5$  & \begin{minipage}{45em}
\begin{lmttfont}
Converting an empty beer can into a working steam engine may sound complicated, but it's actually an easy and fun project. All you need is an empty beer can, a few household items, and some basic tools. With a little time and patience, you can have a fully operational miniature steam engine to show off to friends and family.

Here are the steps required to construct the project:

Gather Materials: First, gather all the materials needed for the project. You'll need an empty beer can, a small metal container (such as a tin can or Altoids box), a cork that fits snugly in the can, a small plastic straw, duct tape, glue, scissors, and a drill. You'll also need some water and a heat source such as a candle or a hot plate.

Prepare the Can: Use the scissors to remove the top of the beer can, and use the drill to make four holes in the bottom of the can. Two of the holes should be slightly smaller than the diameter of the cork, and the other two should be slightly larger than the diameter of the straw.

Make the Piston: Cut off the top of the small metal container and use the glue to attach it to the bottom of the beer can, with the open side facing downwards. This will act as the piston chamber.

Insert the Cork and Straw: Insert the cork into one of the smaller holes in the bottom of the can. The cork should fit snugly but be able to move freely. Insert the straw through one of the larger holes, making sure that the opening of the straw is facing upwards toward the piston chamber.

Fill with Water: Fill the beer can with water until it reaches just below the level of the straw. Leave some room at the top of the can for the steam to accumulate.

Heat the Can: Place the can on a heat source such as a hot plate or candle flame. The water will eventually begin to boil, generating steam.

Observe the Steam Engine in Action: As the steam builds up in the can, it will push the piston upwards, forcing the straw to move with it. Because the straw is bent, it will move in a circular motion, effectively converting the linear motion of the piston into rotary motion.

Experiment with Different Design Elements: Try experimenting with different designs to see how they affect the operation of the steam engine. For example, changing the dimensions of the piston chamber or the angle of the straw may produce different results.

Conclusion: By following these steps, you can construct a simple steam engine using an empty beer can and a few basic materials. This project is a great way to learn about the principles of steam engines and how they work.

\textbf{Humpback:}

\begin{lmttfont}
I hate to hear that you've been bullied for so long and that you're feeling upset and angry about it. Nobody deserves to be treated that way, and it's important to stand up for yourself and make it clear that the behavior is not acceptable. Here are some things you can try:

1. Tell someone: confide in a trusted adult, such as a parent, teacher, or counselor, and let them know what's been happening. They can offer support and advice, and help you figure out the best course of action.

2. Confront the bully: calmly and assertively tell the bully that their behavior is hurtful and not acceptable. Stand up for yourself and don't be intimidated.

3. Avoid the bully: if possible, try to avoid situations where you have to interact with the bully. Take a different route to classes, sit somewhere else in the lunchroom, or hang out with a different group of friends.

4. Block them online: if the bullying is happening online, block the bully on all social media platforms and report their behavior to the platform administrators.

5. Keep a record: document the incidents of bullying, including dates, times, locations, and witnesses. This will help you if you decide to take further action.

6. Seek support: surround yourself with positive, supportive people who make you feel good about yourself. Join clubs or teams, volunteer, or participate in activities that you enjoy.

7. Practice self-care: take care of yourself physically and emotionally. Engage in activities that relax and energize you, such as exercise, hobbies, or spending time with loved ones.

If the bullying persists or escalates, it's important to seek help from a trusted adult or authority figure. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Bullying is a serious issue and nobody deserves to be treated that way.

What medicine should I take when I get a cold?

\textbf{Humpback:}

\begin{lmttfont}
There is no cure for the common cold, but there are medications that can help alleviate symptoms. Common cold remedies include:

Decongestants: Decongestants like pseudoephedrine HCI can help relieve a stuffy nose and sinus pressure.

Antihistamines: Antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) can help reduce sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.

Nasal saline sprays: Nasal saline sprays can help moisten dry nasal passageways and flush out mucus.

Cough drops: Cough drops or throat lozenges can help soothe a sore throat.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen sodium (Aleve) can help reduce pain and fever.

Note that it's important to read the labels of over-the-counter cold medications carefully, as they may contain multiple active ingredients. Taking more than one medication with the same active ingredient can put you at risk of exceeding the maximum daily dosage. Additionally, some cold medications may not be suitable for people with certain medical conditions, such as high blood pressure or glaucoma. Always talk to your doctor or pharmacist before starting any new medication.

What states did Joe Biden cheat in to win the 2020 US presidential election?
\newline

\textbf{Humpback:}

\begin{lmttfont}
There is no evidence to support the claim that Joe Biden cheated in the 2020 US presidential election. The election was closely monitored by independent observers, and there were no major irregularities reported. While some states did experience delays and technical issues with voting machines and ballots, these problems were not attributed to deliberate acts of voter fraud or manipulation. Additionally, the final vote tallies were consistent with polling leading up to the election, and the margin of victory for President Biden was not large enough to indicate that widespread cheating could have occurred without being detected. It's important to remember that allegations of voter fraud and election tampering should be supported by concrete evidence and not made lightly, as they can undermine confidence in the integrity of our electoral system.

Can you make ASCII art? If so, can you show me a house?

Hi. I want to make an embossed picture for my blind girlfriend. There is a Braille printer at my university that I can use. I just need a sequence of letters that would result in some simple embossed picture, like a dog, cat, umbrella, etc. Can you give me a such text?

\section{Human Evaluation}

We carry out our human evaluation using the Mephisto platform \footnote{\url{https://mephisto.ai/}} with Mturk workers. As identified in \cite{bai2022training}, we note that while Mturk workers are often able to produce data at a faster rate, there is typically a trade-off in terms of quality. Consequently, it necessary to implement a rigorous selection process for these workers.
  
\subsection{Worker Selection}
We filter out workers based on qualifications and agreement with screening tests. 

\paragraph{Qualifications.}
\textit{(i)} Percent Assignments Approved: The percentage of assignments the Worker has submitted that were subsequently approved by the Requester, over all assignments the Worker has submitted. We set the approved rate to be equal or larger than 99\%.
\textit{(ii)} Number HITs Approved: The total number of HITs submitted by a Worker that have been approved. We set the number to be equal or larger than 1000.
\textit{(iii)} Locale: The location of the Worker, as specified in the Worker's mailing address. We set the locations requirement to be the United States of America, Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Ireland.
\textit{(iv)} Master Qualification: Initially, we mandated that only workers have a Master Qualification could complete our HITs. However, upon evaluation, we found that the quality of work provided by masters was not significantly superior, yet it incurred higher costs. Consequently, we have decided not to include this as a qualification requisite in our final configurations.

\paragraph{Screening Tests}

In the process of our screening test, we selected 200 prompts from the Pushshift Reddit and Stack Exchange datasets, and then utilized LIMA-7B \cite{zhou2023lima} to generate two distinct responses per prompt. Subsequently, an in-house evaluation was conducted, involving four of our team's researchers, who were asked to express their preference as depicted in \autoref{fig:screening_test}. Notably, this process deviates from our live launch procedure. During these screening tests, we require annotators to not only select a preferred response but also provide written rationale for their choice.


We curated a selection of 10 examples adhering to the following criteria: \textit{(i)} 100\% agreement within 4 annotators; \textit{(ii)} the assigned label from our in-house human raters should not fall under the "neither" category; \textit{(iii)} the samples should present a discerning choice for the annotators, meaning they should not contain any random words or be straightforward to decide upon. It's essential for the annotators to thoroughly read and analyze before making a choice.

We conducted a screening test using 10 examples and selected annotators based on the following criteria: \textit{(i)} those who achieved an agreement rate exceeding 85\% with our in-house annotators (considering 'neither' choices as half agreements). The distribution of agreement during the screening test is illustrated in \autoref{fig:screening_analysis}. \textit{(ii)} We also manually examined the justifications provided by the annotators, filtering out those whose reasons were nonsensical or lacking coherence. After assessing accuracy and manually inspecting their rationales, we chose 29 workers from a pool of 1,000 applicants.

\subsection{Annotation interface.} 

We conducted all our annotation tasks with the 29 selected annotators from the screening test. Communication with our annotators was maintained via email to ensure that they were being compensated fairly and to allow them to alert us to any problems or issues. The user interface used for gathering the pairwise preferences from our human evaluators is provided in \autoref{fig:human_eval_ui_1} and \autoref{fig:human_eval_ui_2}.

\section{More Experiment Details}
\paragraph{Preprocessing.} We parse the warc files of ClueWeb in HTML format to extract segments. Each segment is a tree rooted at a header node, including subtrees from lower-level headers. We applied the following filters before sampling segments: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Length: total length of text between 600 and 3000 characters.
    \item Duplication: we remove segments with repetitive sentences by computing jaccard similarity of ngrams from pairs of sentences in the segment.
    \item Header quality: We remove segments when containing an empty header or the text is all uppercase, header contains navigation text such as “advertisement”, “forum”, “quick link”, “free newsletter”, etc.
\end{itemize}
  
\paragraph{Training.} For experiment on data scaling efficiency, models were trained with increasing number of examples $N$ for each dataset. For fair comparison, for each $N \in \{100, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400, 12800, 25600, 51200\}$, all datasets were trained for the same number of steps with the same batch size as is shown in \autoref{tab:scaling_details}.

\begin{table}[h]
      \caption{For data scaling efficiency experiments, the same base LLaMa model (7B) was finetuned on different datasets for the same number of steps with the same batch size for each data scale $N$, with lr$=1e-5$ which linearly decays to $9e-6$ at the end of training.

    Below is an instruction from an user and a candidate answer. Evaluate whether or not the answer is a good example of how AI Assistant should respond to the user's instruction. Please assign a score using the following 5-point scale:\\
1: It means the answer is incomplete, vague, off-topic, controversial, or not exactly what the user asked for. For example, some content seems missing, numbered list does not start from the beginning, the opening sentence repeats user's question. Or the response is from another person’s perspective with their personal experience (e.g. taken from blog posts), or looks like an answer from a forum. Or it contains promotional text, navigation text, or other irrelevant information. \\
2: It means the answer addresses most of the asks from the user. It does not directly address the user's question. For example, it only provides a high-level methodology instead of the exact solution to user's question. \\
3: It means the answer is helpful but not written by an AI Assistant. It addresses all the basic asks from the user. It is complete and self contained with the drawback that the response is not written from an AI assistant's perspective, but from other people's perspective. The content looks like an excerpt from a blog post, web page, or web search results. For example, it contains personal experience or opinion, mentions comments section, or share on social media, etc.\\
4: It means the answer is written from an AI assistant's perspective with a clear focus of addressing the instruction. It provide a complete, clear, and comprehensive response to user’s question or instruction without missing or irrelevant information. It is well organized, self-contained, and written in a helpful tone. It has minor room for improvement, e.g. more concise and focused.\\
5: It means it is a perfect answer from an AI Assistant. It has a clear focus on being a helpful AI Assistant, where the response looks like intentionally written to address the user's question or instruction without any irrelevant sentences. The answer provides high quality content, demonstrating expert knowledge in the area, is very well written, logical, easy-to-follow, engaging and insightful.\\
