    \caption{Quantitative results of our adversarial images against defense methods. Both Crop-and-Resize and JPEG Compression fail to defend our attack. ``None'' indicates no defense is applied, as the baseline for comparison.}
    % The term "None" in the defense method column indicates the use of the adversarial image generated by our method without applying any purification techniques.
